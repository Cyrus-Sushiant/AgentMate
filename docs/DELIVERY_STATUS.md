## Unverified criteria

Reviewed in E17 (2026-10-03). What follows is what no test has shown yet, or has shown only on
this machine.

**The first nightly run** (37097759993, dispatched on 6d498a9)

- Green: every Deploy system test on Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 13 and Rocky 9 (installs as root and
  with sudo, stacks, private registries, exec and journal, the Security center, and the Rocky 9
  podman case, E06 AC4), ufw and direct TLS, and firewalld. Debian 13 and Rocky 9 had never run
  these in CI before.
- The server core's own system tests (nginx `-t` harness and Pebble, which no workflow ran
  before): 18 of 19 passed, Pebble issue and renew included (E11 AC1). The one failure,
  `RockyNginxApplyTests.A_release_the_core_applies_serves_with_basic_auth_and_logs_per_site`, was
  a product bug: nginx retries a port in use five times, 500 ms apart, and the core called the
  reload refused at the first line, so the next apply read the rest as its own cause. Fixed on
  2026-10-03 with a unit test that failed with the nightly's message first, and the port-in-use
  system test now applies again straight after (see the E10 notes). All 18 pass locally; the
  next nightly run is the CI check.

**Not covered by any test**

- E05 AC3 and AC4: recovery after a real reboot and a stream across a real token expiry are tested
  with the fake core and the DevHost's pretend reboot, not a rebooting machine.
- E14: the origin lock runs against the pretend firewalls in the e2e run and through a real
  `nginx -t` in the system tests, but not against Cloudflare's live API; DNS-01 waits a fixed 20
  seconds and was not run against Cloudflare. Origin CA is covered with a test-signed certificate.
- E16: direct TLS over a real network (not a Docker port mapping on loopback) and on a firewalld
  server have no automated run; firewalld rule matching is unit-tested only. `directTls.e2e.ts`
  is skipped on macOS (the DevHost's TLS 1.3 listener does not serve there).
- E10 and E11, desktop: the Websites e2e spec runs against the DevHost's simulated nginx and
  pretend CA on every OS. Real nginx and Pebble through the app are covered by the full-stack run,
  on Linux only.
- E06: the container console has no e2e test (component and adapter tests only).
- E15: the restore screen has no e2e test (the DevHost has no SSH).
- E18: the Codex image answer for Remote Desktop was not verified locally.

**Needs a VM or hardware**

None of these can run in a container on a GitHub runner, so the full-stack run does not cover them
either.

- SELinux enforcing (E03, E10 T7): `restorecon` and the SELinux booleans only run where SELinux is
  on, and the Rocky 9 container runs without it, so they are covered by unit tests only. It needs a
  Rocky VM with SELinux enforcing, which a GitHub runner without KVM cannot host.
- arm64 (E03): the linux-arm64 build cross-compiles, but no arm64 test server runs an install, and
  the full-stack run uses linux-x64 only.
- The signed release path (E03): a packaged build downloading its core from a GitHub release, and
  the CD job that publishes both architectures, attests them and embeds the manifest, first run on
  the next `v*` tag. Until then the download source is covered with a fake downloader, the publish
  script was run by hand for linux-x64 and linux-arm64, and the full-stack run installs an
  unsigned development build from `pnpm server-core:publish`.

**Proven since the last review**

- E17 AC1: `deployFullStack.e2e.ts` ran the whole story in one run, the built app against a real
  test server, on Ubuntu 24.04 (ufw) and Rocky 9 (firewalld) locally on 2026-10-03: install from
  the wizard, two-factor, Docker, a stack with an environment, a private pull from registry:2, a
  site with a Pebble certificate over HTTP-01 through the core's nginx, a firewall change that
  reverted by itself, and a crash loop fixed by an approved Deploy AI command. It found that
  HTTP-01 had never worked on an installed core (the ACME webroot's folders were 0700 under the
  core's `UMask=0077`, so nginx answered the CA with 404), now fixed and unit-tested.
- E12 AC3 (2026-10-03): `appStoreHttps.int.test.ts` installs WordPress from the App Store on a
  test server, puts it on a domain and issues its certificate from Pebble through nginx; curl
  gets the WordPress setup page over HTTPS, verified against Pebble's root. Passed locally; it runs
  in the nightly Ubuntu 24.04 job. It found that the install sheet named the site's upstream
  service with a space, which the core refuses, so "put it on a domain" always stopped at the
  site; fixed. It also hit the 0700 webroot folders that the full-stack run fixed.

- In CI run 37084799281 (E09), "Server core on test servers" passed: installs on Ubuntu and Rocky
  as root and with sudo, the firewall on ufw and firewalld (E13), private registries (E08), direct
  TLS behind ufw (E16) and exec and journal on Ubuntu (E09).
- E11 AC3 now has a test from alert to inbox entry. It found that the inbox titled a failed
  renewal "Alert on <server>"; the renewal, firewall rollback and Cloudflare lock alerts now have
  their own titles.
- Every Deploy screen had its visual and keyboard pass in both themes (E17 T2), with
  `deployKeyboard.e2e.ts` as the lasting check.
- E04 T11: enrollment codes have their screen since E15 (Security, Devices).
- E01, E03 AC5 and E04 were proven earlier: the Server core job in CI runs 36490352987 and
  36491482619 (E01 AC1); the DevHost, navigation and sign-in specs on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS in
  run 36647129514; all E03 and E04 system tests in run 36677124032, after time limits on every SSH
  wait, a private cgroup namespace for the test servers, and unloading the runner's AppArmor
  profile for unix_chkpwd.

## Known failures outside the Deploy work

The `[e2e]` run for dc698a8 (CI run 36501786157) is red because of end-to-end specs that predate
the Deploy epics and touch none of their code. The matrix had not run since those features
landed, so nothing caught them earlier:

- `apiClient.e2e.ts:40` (all OSes): expects the response header `x-echo`; the table now shows
  `X-Echo`, as the server sent it.
- `settingsPersistence.e2e.ts:77` (all OSes): two buttons are named "Remove Ctrl+P", so the
  locator is ambiguous.
- macOS: the local-terminal specs (autoContinue, launchFlags, terminal, Fix with AI) never see
  "Fake Claude ready".
- Windows: a few more visibility and count assertions in the same run.

Still failing in the E04 runs (36647129514 through 36677124032), none of them Deploy code:

- All OSes: `apiClient.e2e.ts:40` and `settingsPersistence.e2e.ts:77`, as above.
- macOS: the local-terminal specs above, plus `windowState.e2e.ts:99` and `worktrees.e2e.ts:44`
  (`workspaceSearch.e2e.ts:33` failed once too).
- Windows: `browser.e2e.ts:115`, `lastPage.e2e.ts:85`, `windowState.e2e.ts:81` and
  `worktrees.e2e.ts:44`.

The same set was still failing in the E09 run (37084799281), and nothing else: Ubuntu only
`apiClient.e2e.ts:40` and `settingsPersistence.e2e.ts:77`; Windows those two plus
`browser.e2e.ts:115`, `windowState.e2e.ts:81` and `worktrees.e2e.ts:44`; macOS those two plus
the local-terminal specs (autoContinue, launchFlags, terminal, testsPanel Fix with AI),
`windowState.e2e.ts:99` and `worktrees.e2e.ts:44`. No Deploy spec failed on any OS there (the
Docker and macOS TLS ones skip where they cannot run).

The Deploy-related specs pass: `deploy.e2e.ts` (DevHost health, sign-in with two-factor) and
`navigation.e2e.ts` on every OS, and `sshAiTask.e2e.ts` on Ubuntu (the only runner with Docker).
Left for the owner of those features.

## Open blockers

None.
