# E10 nginx websites

Milestone: M3 Web, SSL and app store. Depends on: E07.

## Goal

Put any app on one or more domains without touching a config file: pick the service and port, toggle
websocket, proxy cache and compression, add custom settings when needed, and never break the
running nginx.

## Tasks

- [x] T1 Install from the nginx.org stable repo (pinned GPG key) on both families, or adopt an
  existing nginx with the stock default site backed up and disabled.
- [x] T2 Managed layout: one include wired into `nginx.conf` once, `/etc/nginx/agentmate/current`
  symlinked to numbered release directories, default server returning 444, ACME challenge location.
- [x] T3 Typed site model and deterministic renderer: domains (IDNA), upstream from a stack service
  port picker, websocket upgrade map, proxy cache zone per site (TTL, bypass, purge), gzip,
  `client_max_body_size`, timeouts, custom headers, security headers, HSTS, HTTP/2, IP allow and
  deny, basic auth, rate limits; HTTP-only rendering until a certificate exists.
- [x] T4 Custom snippet: directive allowlist parser (no `include`, `load_module`, `*_log` paths,
  `alias` or `root` outside the site directory, `lua`, `perl`), Owner-only, shown as a diff.
- [x] T5 Apply: render a new release, swap the symlink, `nginx -t`, reload, or swap back and return
  the parsed error with the line mapped to the user's snippet; crash-safe (a marker file lets the
  core finish or undo an interrupted apply on start).
- [x] T6 `stream` proxies for public TCP and UDP ports with optional IP allowlists.
- [x] T7 SELinux: `httpd_can_network_connect`, `http_port_t` for custom ports.
- [x] T8 Per-site access and error logs in the log viewer.
- [x] T9 UI: Websites list (domains, target, SSL badge, cache and websocket toggles), site editor
  (Domains, Proxy, SSL placeholder, Performance, Security, Advanced with Monaco and inline errors,
  Logs), live route map on the app detail.
- [x] T10 Fixture: `nginx -t` harness on nginx.org packages for Debian and Rocky with a whoami
  upstream and curl checks.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Every renderer variant passes a real `nginx -t` and serves the upstream through curl.
2. A broken snippet leaves the running configuration untouched and reports the line.
3. Upstream targets pointing at link-local, metadata or the core's own socket are refused.
4. Golden-file tests pin the rendered configuration for each option.

## Implementation notes

Desktop and UI (T9, plus the SSL tab of E11 T6):

- Main process: `main/deploy/sites/` (calls on the lasting core link, site log feeds) and the IPC
  groups `deploySites` and `deployCerts` (`main/ipc/deploySites.ts`), main window only, with every
  argument checked for shape and size before the core sees it. The core judges what values mean
  and answers with problems tied to fields, which the editor shows next to the field and on its tab.
- Renderer: `components/deploy/sites/`, a Websites section per server: nginx setup or adoption,
  sites as route maps (domain with lock and days left, nginx chips, upstream; each stop opens its
  tab), a tabbed site editor, stream proxies, and an Apply bar whose problems link to their field.
  Saving only stores a site; Apply puts every saved change live, with a busy state while nginx -t
  and the reload run. Custom snippets are Owner only, edited in Monaco with refused lines marked,
  and shown as a diff before saving; Monaco loads only when the Advanced tab opens.
- Deviation: the preload method for applying is `deploySites.applyChanges`, not `apply` (the
  channel is still `deploySites:apply`). The renderer tests' bridge is a callable Proxy, so a
  method named `apply` resolves to `Function.prototype.apply`; the same goes for `call` and `bind`.
- Site logs have their own subscription registry (`SiteLogSubscriptions`) and a second
  `subscriptionOwners` instance in `main/deploy/index.ts`, so each window's logs end with it
  without widening `DeploySubscriptions`.
- Site logs have no cursor in the contract, so a stream opened again after a drop starts with the
  last lines once more and is marked `reset`: the window replaces what it shows instead of showing
  lines twice. A rotated file arrives marked the same way, and the view says it was rotated.
- The fake core (`shared/deploy/testing/fakeNginx.ts`) answers every nginx and certificate call
  with the core's role rules, for main and renderer tests.
- No visual pass in both themes yet: states are asserted through the DOM, and the e2e spec
  `deploySites.e2e.ts` covers the DevHost flow (set up nginx, add a site, apply, issue a
  certificate and see it live) against the simulated nginx.

Acceptance criteria from the desktop side: none of AC1 to AC4 is exercised by the desktop work;
they belong to the core and its harness. The DevHost run uses simulated nginx, not a real
`nginx -t`.

E17 review (2026-10-03):

- T1 to T8 and T10 were built in 77b262a (renderer, snippet allowlist, harness) and 07db580
  (install, apply, stream proxies, SELinux, site logs); their boxes are ticked now.
- AC1 and AC2 are the server core's system tests (`AgentMate.ServerCore.SystemTests`, nginx.org
  packages on Debian 13 and Rocky 9). They passed when they were written but had never run in CI:
  no workflow ran that project. The nightly workflow now has a job for it. AC3 and AC4 are unit and
  golden-file tests that run on every push.
- Visual and keyboard pass of the Websites section done in E17 (both themes, 1440 and 960 wide).

Rocky apply failure in nightly run 37097759993 (fixed 2026-10-03):

- `RockyNginxApplyTests.A_release_the_core_applies_serves_with_basic_auth_and_logs_per_site` got
  its apply refused with "bind() to 0.0.0.0:3000 failed (Address already in use)", the error the
  class's port-in-use test causes on purpose. It was a product bug, not the harness. When a port
  is taken, nginx's master tries bind() five times, 500 ms apart, writing the error each time, and
  only then gives up (the log shows all five with the same second, since nginx's clock is cached
  while it sleeps). `NginxControl.ReloadAsync` called the reload refused at the first line and
  returned, so the rollback's reload and the next apply measured their place in error.log while
  nginx was still writing about the old attempt, and the leftover lines read as their own cause.
  A real server would have shown the same wrong reason for an apply that came within a few
  seconds of a refused one. On this machine each `docker exec` is slow enough to hide the window,
  which is why the local runs passed; the Linux runner is fast enough to hit it. The shared
  container per test class (and xUnit ordering the Rocky class differently from the Debian one)
  only decided which test caught it.
- Fix: once error.log shows a refused reload, the reload is over only after the log has stopped
  growing for a second (`NginxControl.SettleTime`, longer than nginx's retry gap), still bounded
  by the reload deadline. Repeated identical lines become one problem, so a port in use reads as
  the bind error plus "still could not bind()".
- Tests: the unit test `A_refused_reload_is_over_before_the_apply_returns_so_the_next_apply_gets_no_stale_error`
  failed with the nightly's exact message before the fix (`SimulatedNginxMachine` now retries a
  refused reload like nginx when `BindRetries` is set, and holds back a reload signalled
  meanwhile). The port-in-use system test now also applies again straight after the refusal and
  expects it to go through. All 18 server core system tests pass locally on Docker Desktop.

The E12 AC3 system test also hit the 0700 folders above the ACME webroot (every HTTP-01 order a
404 from the server's own nginx). The E17 full-stack run found the same bug at the same time and
its fix landed first (a7e9ec1, `LocalNginxMachineUmaskTests`); this work kept that fix and dropped
its own copy.
