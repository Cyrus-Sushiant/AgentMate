// Local reconstruction of the rolling limits a Claude Code subscription is
// metered against. This is the fallback for when the account can't be reached;
// everything it produces is explicitly an estimate, and the card labels it as
// such, because none of the numbers below are published figures.
//
// Three things are reconstructed:
//
//   Session (5h). Usage is metered in 5-hour blocks that start with your first
//   message after an idle gap, not on a wall-clock schedule. So the block
//   boundaries are derived from the transcript timestamps themselves.
//
//   Weekly. A 7-day window phased off the account's first-ever token date, the
//   one anchor available locally that doesn't move as old transcripts age out.
//
//   Weekly (Fable). Above Pro, Fable is charged against its own weekly bucket
//   as well as the shared one. Same phase as the weekly window, counting only
//   Fable activity; Pro has no such bucket, so the window is left out entirely.
//
// Consumption is measured in API-equivalent dollars rather than raw tokens.
// A cache read costs a tenth of a fresh input token and Opus several times a
// Sonnet one, so a token count would rank a cache-heavy hour far above a short
// Opus session that actually ate more of the quota.
