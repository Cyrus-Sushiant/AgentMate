 * The Security center's IPC shapes (E15): the checklist, its SSH fixes, and backups. SSH changes

 * with this computer's key, then kept over another new one, or reverted. Backups are encrypted on
 * the server with the user's passphrase and saved where the user picks; a restore runs over SSH as
 * root, so it also works on a new server.
