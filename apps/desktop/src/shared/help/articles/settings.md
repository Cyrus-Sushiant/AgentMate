Settings holds the defaults for this machine: how AgentMate looks, which agent CLI starts by default, your keyboard shortcuts, AI provider keys, notifications, the network and your backups. The page is split into nine tabs, and every card inside a tab is described below. Most cards save the moment you change them. A few hold your edits until you press **Save changes**, and this article says which.

## Where to find it

Click **Settings** in the main menu (it sits at the bottom of the sidebar, or at the right end of the top menu bar). You can also open the command palette (`Ctrl+K`) and type Settings. The page opens on the **General** tab, and each tab has its own address, for example `/settings?tab=agents`. The tab names are **General**, **Agents**, **Shortcuts**, **AI Pet**, **AI**, **Notifications**, **Network**, **Vault** and **Data**.

## Search and saving

### Search settings

The search box at the top of the category list filters every card on every tab. Press `Ctrl+F` (`Cmd+F` on macOS) to jump into it and `Esc` to clear it. While you search, no single tab is open: matching cards are grouped under their tab name, and the number beside each tab in the list says how many of its cards match. Try words like theme, API key, Telegram, backup or proxy. If nothing matches you see "No settings match" with a **Clear search** button.

### Which cards save right away

Some cards write your change as soon as you make it. Others keep a draft until you save.

| Saves immediately | Waits for **Save changes** |
| --- | --- |
| Appearance and Main menu, the switches in the top card of General, Android SDK, everything on **Agents**, **Shortcuts**, **AI Pet**, Writing check, **Vault**, the Network ping method | Projects folder, Providers, Voice input, Translation retries, Telegram bot, Proxy, Network ping targets |

When something is waiting to be saved, its card shows an **Unsaved** badge, its tab gets a dot, the page subtitle reads "You have unsaved changes." and a bar appears at the bottom with **Discard** and **Save changes**. You can also press `Ctrl+S` (`Cmd+S` on macOS) to save everything at once. **Discard** throws away every draft on the page.

## General

The **General** tab covers how AgentMate looks, where it opens and the everyday defaults for this machine.

### Appearance

Pick a theme by clicking one of the five preview tiles: **Light** (bright canvas), **Dark** (near-black canvas), **System** (follow this machine), **VS Code Dark** (blue accent, editor-inspired) and **VS 2026** (violet accent, modern IDE). The change applies instantly.

Below the themes, **Main menu** chooses where the navigation lives. **Left** puts it in a sidebar down the left edge. **Top** moves it to a menu bar under the title bar so pages get the full width. The menu moves as soon as you click.

### Startup page

**Startup page** decides where AgentMate opens. **Last opened page** (the default) brings back the page and project you were on, whether you closed the app, it restarted for an update or the computer shut down. You can instead pin one page from the list (Dashboard, Token Usage, Prompt Builder, Projects, Workspace, API Client, Pipelines, Deploy, Skills, MCP Servers, Agent Tools, Docker, Android, AI CLI Manager, Ask AI, Remote, Vault or Settings). The list has its own search box.

### Keep terminals running

When **Keep terminals running** is on (the default), terminal sessions carry on in the background after you quit AgentMate and come back with their output the next time you open it. Restarting to install an update always keeps them. If you turn it off, quitting stops the sessions. When you close the app with sessions open, AgentMate asks "Close AgentMate?" first and tells you what will happen to them.

### Workspace notifications

**Workspace notifications** (on by default) sends a system notification when an agent in a Workspace tab finishes or asks you something while you are looking at another tab, another page or another app. See [Notifications and Telegram](notifications-telegram.md#workspace-notifications) for what the notification says and where a click takes you.

### Terminal AI notifications

**Terminal AI notifications** (on by default) sends a system notification when an AI task in a terminal asks you a question or waits for you to approve a command, while that terminal is hidden or you are in another app. It covers AI tasks started from SSH terminals and Remote Desktop sessions. Details are in [Notifications and Telegram](notifications-telegram.md#terminal-ai-notifications).

### Check for CLI and tool updates

**Check for CLI and tool updates** (on by default) checks every installed CLI and tool for a newer version once a day and adds an entry to **Recent messages** (the bell in the header) when it finds one. It does not install anything. To update a CLI, open [AI CLI Manager](cli-manager.md).

### Workspace terminal background

**Workspace terminal background** is off by default, so a Workspace terminal pane looks the way its CLI would in any ordinary terminal (for example Claude Code's own gray). Turn it on to paint a fixed color behind the terminal instead. A color swatch appears under the switch, and the text color adjusts to stay readable on it.

### Projects folder

**Projects folder** is where folder pickers open instead of the system default. Type a path or click **Browse...**, then save. Clear the field and save to go back to "wherever the system last left off". This card waits for **Save changes**.

### Skill repositories

**Skill repositories** shows how many repositories are configured. Adding and syncing sources happens on the Skills page, so the **Manage** button just takes you there. See [Skills](skills.md).

### Blueprint presets

**Blueprint presets** are reusable snippets for a project's Blueprint. In the Blueprint wizard, clicking a preset chip appends its text to that step.

1. Pick a **Step** from the list: **Idea**, **Architecture**, **Backend**, **Frontend**, **CI/CD** or **Quality**. A badge shows how many presets that step has.
2. Under **New preset**, type the chip text (up to 60 characters) and the text that gets appended when the chip is clicked.
3. Click **Add preset**. To change one, click the pencil on its row, edit it and click **Save changes** (or **Cancel**). The trash button removes a preset after you confirm. Blueprints that already used it keep their text.

### Android SDK

**Android SDK** says where the Android page looks for adb, the emulator and the command-line tools. The card shows the folder it found and how: set here, from `ANDROID_HOME`, from `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, or found in the usual install folder. If nothing is found, click **Browse** and pick the folder that holds `platform-tools` and `emulator`. **Clear** goes back to automatic detection. The switch **Stop emulators when AgentMate quits** is off by default, because an emulator is a window you can close yourself and it takes a while to boot again. See [Android](android.md).

## Agents

The **Agents** tab covers which CLI starts, how each one launches and how agents work with git. Everything here saves as you change it.

### Default CLI

**Default CLI** is the agent AgentMate uses when a feature needs an AI provider without asking you. Pick one from the list, or clear it to have none. When one is selected a **Background task arguments** box appears for that CLI. Those flags are used only when AgentMate runs the CLI in the background (commit messages, tag suggestions, version bumps and skill audits), never for terminals. Press `Enter` or click away to save them. Every CLI has the same box in [AI CLI Manager](cli-manager.md).

### Launch defaults

**Launch defaults** sets the model, effort and permission mode each agent starts with in a Workspace tab or terminal. Each installed agent that has launch flags gets a row. Click a row to open it, then choose:

- **Model**: pick from the list or type a model name and choose **Use "name"**.
- **Effort**: **Not set**, **Low**, **Med**, **High**, **XHigh** or **Max**, limited to what the chosen model supports.
- **Mode**: cards such as **Not set** or the CLI's own permission modes. Modes that let the agent edit files and run commands without asking are marked with a warning triangle and a red-tinted note.

A preview line shows exactly what the terminal will type, and **Reset** clears the row. Anything left on **Not set** adds no flag and the CLI picks for itself. Hold `Alt` while clicking a launcher to start an agent without these defaults. Agents that are not installed are tucked behind **Show N not installed**.

### Agent order

**Agent order** is the order agents are listed in when you start one in the Workspace (the **+** menu and the tiles in an empty pane). Drag a row, or use its up and down arrows. Installed agents get number keys 1 to 9 in this order, shown on each row, and the number keys launch them (see [Keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md#workspace)). **Default order** resets the list.

### Commit messages

**Commit messages** controls how the sparkle button in the Workspace changes panel writes a commit message.

- **Written by**: the CLI that writes it. Left empty it uses the project's CLI, then your default CLI.
- **Longest summary line**: a slider from 40 to 120 characters.
- **Style**: **Conventional Commits**, **Plain summary**, **Summary and bullet points** or **My own instructions**.
- **Extra instructions (optional)**, or **Your instructions** when the style is custom. This saves after you stop typing for a moment.
- **Allow a body**: lets the message include a short explanation under the summary line. It is hidden for the bullet-point style, which always has one.

### Worktrees

**Worktrees** holds the app-wide preferences for git worktrees. **New worktrees go** either **Next to the repository** or **In one folder** that you pick (use **Change folder** to switch). **Files to copy** lists patterns, one per line, for untracked local files that new worktrees start with (the default is `.env` and `.env.*`). **Delete the branch when removing a merged worktree** is off by default, and a branch with commits that exist nowhere else is always kept. A project can override the copied files and add a setup command on its own Git tab. See [Worktrees](worktrees.md).

### Review commands

**Review commands** are the comments offered in the Workspace Pull request tab to ask a review bot to look at a pull request. The defaults are `@claude review`, `/gemini review`, `@coderabbitai review` and `@codex review`. Type a new one in the box and click **Add** (or press `Enter`), remove one with the **x** on its chip, or click **Reset to defaults**.

## Shortcuts

### Keyboard shortcuts

The **Shortcuts** tab has one card, **Keyboard shortcuts**, where you rebind the app, Workspace, prompt builder, commit box and Vault shortcuts. Click the **+** next to a command, press the new keys, and use the reset arrow to restore one command or **Restore defaults** for all of them. Changes apply right away. The full list of defaults, the binding rules and the keys that cannot be changed are in [Keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## AI Pet

The **AI Pet** tab controls the desktop companion, a character that lives on your screen. This tab saves as you change it. The full guide, including what the pet does when you click it, is in [Widgets and the desktop pet](widgets-desktop-pet.md).

### My AI Pet

**My AI Pet** has the main switch **Show my AI pet**. Click the pet for a token report, double-click it to bring up AgentMate, right-click it for quick options and drag it to place it. If you hid it from its right-click menu, this card says until when and offers **Show now**. Below it are more cards: **Character** (pick one of the built-in characters or **Add your pet** with a PNG, GIF or WebP up to 8 MB, then name it and flip its walking direction), **Motion** (wander, climb, parachute, 3D rope), **Action speed**, **Alerts** (pipeline failures and passes, internet quality, CLI needs input) and **Size** (display size 50% to 160% and click area 40% to 100%).

## AI

The **AI** tab has API keys, local models, voice input and writing checks.

### Providers

**Providers** holds the OpenAI key and model, the Gemini key and model, the Ollama server URL, model, context length and keep-alive, and the **Prompt Builder provider** (OpenAI, Gemini or Ollama). Each key shows a **Key set** or **No key** badge. Ollama has a **Test connection** button that shows **Connected** with the version, or **Not reachable**. This card waits for **Save changes**. The step-by-step setup is in [AI providers](ai-providers.md).

### Voice input

**Voice input** sets the local Whisper model and the spoken language for dictation in Prompt Builder. **Model** is **Tiny** (fastest, about 75 MB), **Base** (balanced, about 145 MB, the default) or **Small** (most accurate, about 490 MB). The model downloads once and stays cached. **Spoken language** is **Auto-detect** or one of English, Persian, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Hindi or Turkish. This card waits for **Save changes**. See [Writing, voice and translation](writing-voice-translation.md).

### Writing check

**Writing check** gives grammar, spelling and style checks in every text box, powered by LanguageTool. It has switches for **Check my writing**, **Underline as I type** and **Include style suggestions**, a **Language** and a **Native language**, and a choice of where checks run: **LanguageTool online** (no setup, text is sent to api.languagetool.org) or **Local server** (offline, needs the LanguageTool download and Java 17 or newer). A **Muted rules** list lets you unmute rules you silenced. This card saves as you change it. See [Writing, voice and translation](writing-voice-translation.md).

### Translation retries

**Translation retries** is the number of extra attempts Prompt Builder makes if a translate request fails. Enter a number from 0 to 10 (the default is 3). This card waits for **Save changes**.

## Notifications

### Telegram bot

The **Notifications** tab has the **Telegram bot** card, used by project notification hooks, scheduled task updates and usage reset alerts. A badge shows **Ready** once both a token and a chat ID are filled in, otherwise **Not configured**.

1. Create a bot with @BotFather on Telegram and paste its token into **Bot token**.
2. Send your bot any message on Telegram, then click **Detect from last message** to fill in **Chat ID**.
3. Optionally fill in **Scheduled tasks chat/group ID** so scheduled prompts post to a different chat.
4. Click **Send test**, and **Save changes** when it works.

This card waits for **Save changes**. See [Notifications and Telegram](notifications-telegram.md) and [Scheduled tasks](scheduled-tasks.md).

## Network

### Proxy

**Proxy** controls how AgentMate reaches the internet: the AI providers, skill and package registries, Telegram, update checks, and the CLIs and git commands it runs for you. Choose **No proxy**, **System proxy** (follow this machine, PAC scripts included) or **Manual proxy** (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5 or SOCKS4 with host, port, optional username and password, and a **Skip the proxy for** list). **Test connection** checks the setup, and **Save** applies it. Terminals that are already open keep the old setting until you reopen them. This card waits for a save.

### Network ping targets

**Network ping targets** decides how connection quality is measured for the status bar, the dashboard Network Status graph and the pet's internet alerts. Pick a **Method**: **Ping command** (uses the system ping, fails where ICMP is blocked), **URL request** (times an HTTPS request, works behind most firewalls) or **Auto** (ping first, switch to URLs if nothing answers). Under **Hosts to ping** add addresses (the default is `1.1.1.1`) and press `Enter` after each one. Under **URLs to request** add web addresses (the default is `https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204`, with **Reset to default**) and set **Request every** from 1 to 300 seconds. This card waits for **Save changes**.

## Vault

### Auto-lock and clipboard

The **Vault** tab controls when the Vault locks itself and how long copied secrets stay on the clipboard. It saves as you change it.

- **Lock after**: 1, 5, 15 (default), 30 or 60 minutes, or **Never**.
- **Clear copied values after**: 10, 20, 30 (default), 60 or 90 seconds, or **Never**. The clipboard is only cleared if it still holds what the Vault copied.
- **Lock when this computer locks or sleeps**: locks as soon as you step away.
- **Change master password** (only while the Vault is unlocked) re-encrypts the Vault with a fresh key.
- **Reset vault** sets the current vault file aside and starts an empty one. You have to type RESET to confirm. Without the master password, nothing in the Vault can be opened.

See [Vault](vault.md).

## Data

### Backup & restore

The **Backup & restore** card exports your AgentMate data to a file and restores it from one. Switches choose **Compress as .zip**, **Include project environments** (asks for a password) and **Include the Vault**. **Export backup** writes the file, and **Restore from backup...** replaces what is on this machine. The details, including what is and is not in a backup, are in [Backup and restore](backup-restore.md).

### About

**About** shows the app name with its version number (or "dev build" when you run from source) and the update state. The button changes with the state: **Check for updates**, **Download**, **Resume download**, **Pause** and **Show** while downloading, and **Restart now** once the update is downloaded. Checks run automatically every hour. Downloads never start on their own, and they resume if your connection drops. See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#updates-fail-or-stop) if an update fails.

## Tips

- Use the search box instead of hunting through tabs: it searches every tab at once.
- If a change did not stick, look for the **Unsaved** badge and the **Save changes** bar at the bottom of the page.
- Press `F1` anywhere to open the Help page, which has its own search and the **Ask the guide** chat.
