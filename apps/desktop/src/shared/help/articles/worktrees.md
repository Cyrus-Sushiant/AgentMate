A git worktree is a second folder of the same repository, checked out on its own branch. In AgentMate, every worktree gets a full workspace of its own: its own panes, terminals, agents and changes. That lets you run several agents on different tasks at the same time without them editing each other's files, and your main checkout stays exactly as you left it.

This page covers creating a worktree, moving between them, finishing one by merging it back or opening a pull request, removing one, and the settings that shape how new ones are made.

## Where to find it

- Right-click a project tile in the [Workspace](workspace.md) rail and choose **New worktree…**.
- Click the branch switcher in the Workspace header and choose **New worktree…**.
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+N` (`Cmd+Shift+N` on macOS) in the Workspace.
- Open the **Worktrees** section of **Source control** in the right panel and click **New worktree** (the **+**).
- Open the command palette, type the project name, and pick **New worktree of {project}**.
- In the **Branches** section, hover a branch and click **Open in a new worktree**.

## Create a worktree

The **New worktree** dialog keeps everything on one screen with sensible defaults. For the common case, type a branch name and press `Enter`.

1. **Task** (optional). Describe what should happen in the worktree. It can name the branch for you, and it becomes the agent's first prompt.
2. Choose **New branch** or **Existing branch**.
   - **New branch**: type a **Branch name**, such as `feat/my-change`. Click the sparkle button (**Suggest a branch name from the task**) to have your AI CLI propose one from the task, which needs some task text first. The branch starts from the base shown next to it (the repository's default branch unless you pick another from **Based on**).
   - **Existing branch**: pick a branch from the list. Branches already open in another worktree, and the branch you have checked out, are not offered.
3. **Location** shows the folder the worktree will be created in. Click **Change…** to choose another parent folder, or **Reset** to go back to the default.
4. **Setup**:
   - **Copy local files** copies files that git does not track, such as `.env`, into the new folder. The line under it lists the files that matched. It is unavailable when nothing matches.
   - **Setup command** is something to run in the new worktree, such as `pnpm install`. It runs in its own terminal tab. If you change the command, a checkbox, **Use this for every new worktree of {project}**, saves it for the project.
5. **Start an agent**: pick one of your installed agents, or **No agent**. Your default agent is selected to begin with. If you wrote a task, it is typed into the agent as its first prompt, ready for you to send.
6. Click **Create worktree**, or press `Ctrl+Enter` (`Cmd+Enter`).

The dialog then lists its steps as it goes: **Creating the worktree**, **Copying {n} local files**, **Opening its workspace**, **Running setup** and **Starting {agent}**. When it finishes, it closes and you are in the new worktree's workspace. If something fails, a note says whether the worktree was created, and **Back** returns you to the form with everything you typed.

Some things the dialog tells you along the way:

- A branch name git does not allow shows a red explanation.
- If a branch with that name already exists, you see **A branch named {name} already exists.** with **Use the existing branch**.
- If the project is not a git repository, it says it cannot have worktrees yet. Set up git on the project's Git tab first (see [Projects](projects.md)).

### Where worktrees are created

By default a worktree goes next to your repository, in a folder named after it, for example `…/my-app.worktrees/feat-login`. In **Settings** you can instead keep all of them under one folder you choose, for example `{folder}/my-app/feat-login`. The dialog's **Change…** button can override this for one worktree. See the settings section below.

## Moving between worktrees

Each worktree is a separate workspace, so switching does not stop anything. Terminals and agents keep running in the one you leave.

### In the rail

Worktrees hang under their project's tile in the rail, joined by a thin line. Each tile shows the branch's initials and is colored like its project.

- Click a tile to open that worktree's workspace. The one on screen has a ring.
- A small spinner, amber dot or green dot on a tile shows an agent working, waiting, or finished, as on project tiles. A quiet amber dot in the corner means the worktree has uncommitted changes. A warning triangle means its folder is missing.
- Hover a tile for the branch, what it was created from, its folder, its changes and commits, and how many terminals are open.
- Right-click a tile for its actions, listed below.
- The dashed **+** under the tiles starts **New {project} worktree**.
- To tidy the rail, right-click the project tile and choose **Hide worktrees**, or hover the tile and click the small arrow. A project with hidden worktrees shows a small count (for example **2**) on its tile. Click it to show them again. A hidden worktree that is on screen stays visible.

### In the header

The switcher at the left of the Workspace header says **main checkout** or the branch of the worktree you are in. Click it to open a list titled **Workspaces of {project}**: the main checkout, then each worktree with its state (**Clean**, a count of changes, commits ahead or behind, or **Folder missing**). Pick one to switch. The list also has **New worktree…** and **Manage worktrees**, which opens the **Worktrees** section.

### Other ways

- Type a branch name in the command palette to find its worktree.
- Click a branch in **Branches** that is checked out in a worktree. AgentMate opens that workspace instead, because git keeps a branch checked out in one place at a time. Such branches are tagged **in worktree**.
- Use **Open {branch}** on a row in the **Worktrees** section.

### How a worktree workspace differs

The line under the page title reads **{project} · worktree {branch} · {folder}**. The empty pane shows a **Worktree {branch}** badge, so you always know where an agent will work. **Run** starts in the worktree's folder. **Tag a version** and **Project details** still belong to the project's main checkout.

## The Worktrees section

In the right panel, the **Worktrees** section of **Source control** lists every worktree of the project, with a count in its header.

Each row shows the branch, a **This workspace** tag on the current one, and tags for **Folder missing**, **Locked** and **Added outside AgentMate** (for worktrees you made with plain git). Under the name are badges for changes (for example **3 changes**), commits ahead (**↑2**) and behind (**↓1**) its base, and its path. Click a row to open it. Click the **⋮** button (**More actions**), or right-click a rail tile, for:

| Action | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Open workspace** | Switches to it. |
| **New agent here** | Opens it and starts your default agent. |
| **New terminal here** | Opens it and starts a shell. |
| **Merge into {base}** | Merges the branch into the branch it started from. See below. |
| **Create pull request** | Opens its workspace on the **Pull request** section. |
| **Reveal in folder** | Shows the folder in File Explorer or Finder. |
| **Copy path** | Copies the worktree's folder path. |
| **Remove worktree…** | Removes it. See below. |

Merge and pull request need a branch (not a detached checkout). Several actions are off for a worktree whose folder is missing.

When you are inside a worktree, the first row is **Main checkout**, to get back to the original folder. With no worktrees yet, the section explains the idea and offers **New worktree**. If some worktree folders were deleted outside AgentMate, a banner says so and **Clean up** tells git to forget them.

## Finishing a worktree

At the top of a worktree's **Source control** tab there is a card with the branch and its base (**{branch} → {base}**), a line on where it stands (for example **2 commits ahead of main**, with any uncommitted changes), and three buttons.

### Merge into the base branch

Click **Merge into {base}**.

1. AgentMate checks both sides first. If something is in the way, it says how to fix it: commit or discard the changes in the worktree, commit or stash changes in the main checkout, switch the main checkout to the base branch, or that there is nothing to merge.
2. It asks **Merge {branch} into {base}?** and explains that the merge happens in the main checkout and nothing is pushed.
3. After a successful merge you get **Merged {branch} into {base}** with a **Remove worktree** button.

If the two branches would conflict, nothing is changed. A message lists the files and offers **Merge {base} in here**, which merges the base into your worktree branch instead. Any conflicts then show up in the worktree's **Changes** list, where you can resolve them by hand or with AI (see [Git in the Workspace](workspace-git.md#conflicts)). Commit once they are resolved, then merge again.

### Create a pull request

**Create pull request** opens the worktree's workspace on the **Pull request** section, so you can push the branch and open a pull request for it. See [Git in the Workspace](workspace-git.md#pull-requests).

### Remove the worktree

**Remove worktree** opens a confirmation. When everything is merged and clean, the card suggests removing it as the next step.

## Remove a worktree

The dialog is titled **Remove the {branch} worktree?** and shows the folder. Before anything happens it spells out what would be lost, worst first:

- **{n} uncommitted changes will be lost.**
- Commits that are not merged into the base, and whether they are pushed or not.
- How many terminals will be stopped, and how many of them have an agent still working.
- If the folder is already gone, that removing only tidies up git.
- When the branch is merged and clean: **Nothing is lost: the branch is merged and clean.**

A checkbox, **Also delete branch {branch}**, is on when the branch is merged, or when the setting below says to delete merged branches. It stays off, and unavailable, for a branch with commits that exist nowhere else, and the dialog tells you to delete that branch from **Branches** once you are sure.

The button reads **Remove worktree**, or **Remove anyway** when uncommitted changes would be lost. AgentMate stops the worktree's terminals first, because Windows will not delete a folder while a shell sits in it, and closes its workspace. If it fails you see the reason and the button changes to **Try again**.

If you delete a worktree's folder yourself, its workspace shows **This worktree's folder is gone** with **Back to {project}** and **Remove worktree**. If a worktree is removed outside AgentMate (for example with `git worktree remove` in a terminal), its workspace closes by itself.

## Worktree settings

### App-wide

In **Settings**, on the **Agents** tab, the **Worktrees** card holds:

- **New worktrees go**: **Next to the repository** or **In one folder** (pick the folder, and **Change folder** later).
- **Files to copy**: patterns, one per line, like `.gitignore`. The default is `.env` and `.env.*`. Only files git does not track are copied, and nothing inside ignored folders such as `node_modules`.
- **Delete the branch when removing a merged worktree**: off by default. A branch with commits that exist nowhere else is always kept.

Changes save by themselves. See [Settings](settings.md#worktrees).

### Per project

On the project's page, open the **Git** tab and find the **Worktrees** card. There you set a **Setup command** that runs in a terminal tab in every new worktree of that project (leave it empty to run nothing), and turn on **Its own files to copy** to give the project its own copy patterns instead of the app-wide ones. See [Projects](projects.md).

## Tips

- Start a worktree per task, then run an agent in each. Their changes cannot collide.
- Put `.env` and `.env.*` in **Files to copy** (the default) so every worktree can run right away, and a setup command such as `pnpm install` on the project.
- If you only want to try an idea, remove the worktree afterwards and tick **Also delete branch**.
- Keep an eye on the rail. An amber dot on a worktree tile means an agent there is waiting on you.
