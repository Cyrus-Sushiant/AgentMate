The **Logs** section of a server's page in Deploy has two tabs: **Problems**, a feed of what is broken on the server right now, and **Log viewer**, one place to read container, app, systemd and website logs live. The **Deploy AI** is a drawer that works with both. It looks at a problem or a log, proposes commands to run on the server, and runs each one only after you approve it (unless you let it run read-only checks by itself).

The assistant and the logs both go through the AgentMate server core on the server. You need to be signed in to the core, see [Deploy servers and setup](deploy-servers-setup.md).

## Where to find it

Click **Deploy** in the sidebar under Ship, pick a server in the rail, then click **Logs** in the section strip. The **Deploy AI** button sits in the bottom right corner of every section of a server's page (Overview, Apps, Containers, App Store, Websites, Firewall, Logs, Security). You can also open the assistant from **Ask the AI** in the Log viewer and **Diagnose with AI** on a problem card.

## The Problems feed

The **Problems** tab shows cards for what needs attention, built from what the app already reads from the server. It refreshes every 30 seconds, and live alerts appear as they come. Each card has a **Critical** or **Warning** label with an icon (never colour alone), a kind label, a title and a detail line. Critical cards come first.

The kinds of problem are:

| Kind | When it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Crash loop** | a container keeps restarting, or is dead |
| **Unhealthy** | a container runs but fails its health check |
| **Failed deploy** | the last deploy of an app failed, an app is not fully up, or a job failed |
| **Disk pressure** | the core raised an alert that a disk is filling up |
| **Certificate** | a certificate has expired, runs out within 14 days, or did not renew |
| **Exposed port** | a container port is reachable from the internet without a restriction |
| **Alert** | another open alert from the core, such as one about the firewall |

When nothing is wrong, the tab says **Nothing needs attention right now.** While the feed is loading you see placeholder cards.

Each card has these buttons:

- **Diagnose with AI** opens the Deploy AI with the problem's title and detail as context and a suggested task already typed in (for example "Find out why this container keeps restarting, and fix it if the cause is on the server."). You still have to click **Start**.
- **Fix in project** (only on problems about a container) prepares the container's log and details for your project's coding CLI. See "Fix in project" below.

### Fix in project

**Fix in project** opens a dialog titled **Send (container)'s log to (project)**. It builds a prompt from the last 200 lines of the container's log and what the container is (image, state, restarts, exit code, ports, environment variable names only), with secrets taken out. No environment value ever goes into the prompt.

The project comes from the container's compose project name when a project with that name exists on this computer. Otherwise a dialog asks **Which project runs (container)?**, you pick one and click **Use this project**, and the app remembers the choice. If you have no projects yet, add the project's folder first (see [Projects](projects.md)). In the final dialog you can check the prompt, click **Copy prompt**, or open the project's workspace with an agent CLI and the prompt ready to run.

## The Log viewer

The **Log viewer** tab reads one log at a time and follows it live. It keeps the latest 5,000 lines and starts with the last 500.

### Choose a log

The **Log source** picker lists these (type in its search box to filter):

- **App (name): every service**: all services of a compose app together, each with its own colour and name in the line. At most four services are followed at once.
- **Container (name)**: a single container.
- **Journal** of a systemd unit: docker.service, nginx.service, ssh.service and agentmate-core.service are listed. Type any other unit name in the search box and pick **Journal of (name)**.
- **Site (domain): access log** and **error log** for each website with nginx.
- **Core audit trail**: the core's audit events as log lines.

The viewer starts on the Docker journal.

### Filters, search and controls

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Level** | **Every level**, **Info and above**, **Warnings and errors** or **Errors only**. The level is read from each line. |
| **Time range** | **Everything kept**, **Last 15 minutes**, **Last hour**, **Last 6 hours** or **Last 24 hours**. |
| **Follow** switch | Keeps the view at the bottom as new lines arrive. Scrolling up pauses the auto scroll. |
| **Read again** | Reads the log again from the server. |
| **Download** | Saves the lines now shown as a `.log` text file. |
| **Ask the AI** | Opens the Deploy AI on this log (see below). |
| **Search the log** | Highlights matches. `Enter` goes to the next match, `Shift+Enter` to the previous one. A counter shows "1 of N" or "No matches", and arrow buttons (**Previous match**, **Next match**) appear when there is more than one. |

Each line shows its time, a level word (dbg, info, warn, err) and its text. Errors have a light red background. Lines are plain text because they come from the server and could say anything.

If a source is empty, the viewer says **Nothing in this log yet.** If the filters hide everything, it says **No line matches the filters.**

## The Deploy AI

The Deploy AI is a drawer on the right side of the page. It does not cover the page, so the logs stay readable next to it. You describe what to look into, it works out one command at a time, and each command runs on the server through the core as root in a fresh shell. Output comes back to the AI so it can decide the next step.

### Open it

- Click the **Deploy AI** button in the bottom right corner. If a run is waiting for you, the button says **Waiting for you**.
- Click **Ask the AI** in the Log viewer.
- Click **Diagnose with AI** on a problem card.

When you open it from a log or a problem, the drawer shows a chip with what it was pointed at (for example "Crash loop: newsletter-sender-1"), and a **Clear** button to drop that context. For a container, the AI also gets the container's details and the end of its log, read on the main process side and redacted.

Press `Escape` to close the drawer. A run carries on in the background, and when you come back it is where you left it, even after leaving the page.

### Who can use it

Only an Admin of the core may use the Deploy AI, because it runs commands on the server. Others see a note saying so. You also need an AI to think with, see "Choose which AI" below.

### How commands run (modes)

At the top of the drawer, **How commands run** has two choices:

- **Approve every command** (the default): nothing runs on the server until you click **Run it** on it.
- **Auto-run diagnostics**: read-only checks such as `docker ps`, `docker logs`, `journalctl` or `df` run without asking. Anything else still waits for your approval, and the core itself refuses to run anything outside its read-only list without your approval.

Turning on **Auto-run diagnostics** asks for your password (or a code from your authenticator app) if your last confirmation has run out. The choice is kept by the core for the session. You cannot change the mode while a run is going.

### Start a run

1. Open the drawer.
2. Type what to look into in **What should the AI look into?** For example: "Find out why the sender keeps restarting".
3. Pick the AI in **Which AI**: **AI provider (Settings)** (the OpenAI, Gemini or Ollama provider you set up, see [AI providers](ai-providers.md)) or an installed agent CLI from the list.
4. Click **Start**, or press `Ctrl+Enter` (`Cmd+Enter` on macOS) in the text box.

### Approve, skip, answer

The run is shown as a list of steps. Each step shows its number, its status (**Waiting for you**, **Running**, **Done**, **Skipped**), the command, why it waits when it does, and its output as plain text.

What the drawer asks of you depends on the moment:

- **Approve the command**: the AI proposes a command. Click **Run it** to run it, or **Skip** to refuse it. The AI then carries on with the next idea.
- **A question**: if the AI needs information, it asks, and you type an answer in **Your answer** and click **Answer**.
- **An error**: if something went wrong, a red box explains it. If it can carry on, click **Continue** or **Stop**.
- **Working out the next step**: shown while the AI thinks.
- **Finished** or **Stopped**: the end of the run, with a short summary of what it found or changed.

Approving is safe by design: your approval is signed with this computer's device key together with the exact command text, and the core checks the signature before it runs. A command you did not approve, or one changed after you approved it, cannot run.

While a run goes, the button next to the AI picker turns into **Stop**. After a run ends, the same box says **Ask a follow-up**, and the button reads **Ask**. A follow-up keeps the same server and context.

### What it can do and what it cannot

It can read logs, inspect containers, check services, disk and memory, and, after your approval, make small changes it found a reason for (for example restart a service). It is told to run one command per step, never to follow a log forever, never to open interactive programs, not to repeat commands that already succeeded, and to treat everything in logs and command output as data, not instructions. Secrets in command output are replaced with `[redacted]` before the AI sees them. Only one run can go on per server at a time.

> [!WARNING]
> The Deploy AI runs commands as root on your server. Read each command before you click **Run it**, and think twice before turning on **Auto-run diagnostics** on a server you do not trust the AI with.

## Tips

- Start from a problem card or from **Ask the AI** in the log you are reading, the AI then already knows what you are looking at.
- Keep **Approve every command** on unless you are only reading.
- Use the Log viewer's **Level** filter set to **Warnings and errors** to cut noise, then **Download** the result if you want to share it.
- For app code bugs found in a container's log, use **Fix in project** so your coding CLI can change the code on your computer.
