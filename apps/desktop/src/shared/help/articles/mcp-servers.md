MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers give an AI agent extra tools, such as talking to GitHub, a database or a payment API. The MCP Servers page is a marketplace: you pick a project, pick a server, and AgentMate writes the server into that project's `.mcp.json` file, which MCP-aware agents like Claude Code read. You can also add your own repositories of servers.

## Where to find it

Click **MCP Servers** in the sidebar under **Agents**, or open the command palette and type "MCP". The page title reads **MCP Marketplace**. You can also open it from a project: the project's **MCP** tab has a **Browse marketplace** button that opens this page with that project already chosen.

## How it works

Installing a server is project-based. AgentMate adds an entry for the server to the `.mcp.json` file in the project's folder and keeps a small record of what it installed (the server, the repository it came from and the version). Removing a server deletes that entry again. Servers are not installed globally from this page, so choose the project you want first.

## The page

### Choose a project

Use the **Project** picker at the top left. Until you choose one, the project box is outlined in a warning color, a hint says "Choose a project to install servers into it", and every **Install** button is disabled. Once a project is chosen, installed servers show an **Installed** badge and a green outline.

### Choose a repository

The **Repository** picker selects where the catalog comes from. The first repository is selected for you.

- **Bowora MCP Directory** is built in. It is bundled with AgentMate (47 servers, mostly under Developer Tools, plus a few DevOps and Infrastructure ones), so it works offline and cannot be refreshed or removed. It carries a **Built-in** badge.
- Any repository you add yourself shows a refresh button and a remove button next to the picker.

### Search and filters

- The **Search** box matches name, description, category, author and tags.
- When a repository has more than one category, a row of chips lets you filter by category (**All** plus each category).
- **Official** shows only servers maintained by the vendor behind them. Official servers carry a blue check mark on their card.
- **Installed (N)** appears once a project is chosen and shows only the servers already installed in it.
- A counter on the right shows how many servers match (for example "12 of 47") and how many are in the chosen project.
- If filters hide everything, **Clear filters** resets them.

Servers are sorted by popularity, then by name.

### Server cards

Each card shows a letter icon, the server name, its category (when the repository has several), a short description, the author, the version (when it is a specific one) and its transport (`stdio` for a local program, or an HTTP-based type for a remote one). The buttons are:

- **Install** adds the server to the chosen project. While it works the button reads **Installing…**.
- **Remove** (instead of **Install**, when the server is already installed) removes it from the chosen project. AgentMate asks you to confirm.
- A globe icon opens the server's website, and a branch icon opens its source repository.

A card marked **Manual setup** has no command or URL that AgentMate could parse, so its **Install** button is disabled. It is listed for discovery only, so follow the server's own docs to set it up.

## Install a server

1. Choose a **Project** at the top.
2. Find the server (search or filter) and click **Install**.
3. If the server needs secrets, a **Configure <server>** dialog appears. Fill in every field (they are masked, like passwords) and click **Install**. The values are written into the project's `.mcp.json` under that server's `env`, so be careful not to commit that file to a public repository. **Install** stays disabled until every field has a value.
4. When the toast says "MCP server installed", restart or reload the agent in that project so it picks up the new server.

> [!WARNING]
> API keys you enter in the **Configure** dialog are stored in plain text in the project's `.mcp.json`. Add that file to `.gitignore` if the project is shared.

## Remove a server

Click **Remove** on an installed server's card and confirm, or open the project's **MCP** tab and click the trash icon next to the server. Either way, AgentMate deletes the server's entry from `.mcp.json` and from its install record.

## Add your own repository

A repository is a catalog of MCP servers described by a `repository.json` index.

1. Click **Add repository**.
2. Enter a **Name** (required).
3. Choose the **Type**:
   - **Local folder**: click the folder icon to browse. The folder must contain a `repository.json`.
   - **Git repository**: a URL such as `https://github.com/org/mcp-servers.git`. AgentMate clones it and pulls updates when you refresh. The repository needs a `repository.json` at its root.
   - **URL (JSON index)**: a link to a `repository.json` file, for example `https://example.com/repository.json`.
4. Click **Add**.

To pick up changes later, select the repository and click the refresh button. If a repository cannot be loaded, the page says "Couldn't load this repository" with a **Try again** button.

To remove a repository, select it and click the trash button. This only removes it from AgentMate, and servers already installed in projects stay put.

## Empty states

- An empty repository shows "<name> is empty" with a hint to refresh it or add another one.
- If you have no matches, the page says "No servers match" and offers **Clear filters**.

## The project's MCP tab

A project's **MCP** tab (see [Projects](projects.md)) lists the servers installed in that project with their versions. From there you can remove a server with the trash icon, or click **Browse marketplace** to add more.

## Tips

- Start with **Official** servers when you can. They are maintained by the vendor.
- Install a server into one project first and try it before adding it to others.
- Check what a server's command does before installing it. Many servers run through `npx`, which downloads and runs a package, so you need Node.js.
- Pair MCP servers with [Skills](skills.md) and [Agent Tools](agent-tools.md) to shape what your agents can do.
