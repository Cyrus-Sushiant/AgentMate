The **Firewall** and **Security** sections of a server's page in Deploy let you control who can reach the server and keep an eye on how safe it is. Firewall changes are staged, reviewed and applied with a countdown, so a bad rule cannot lock you out for long. The Security section holds a checklist with one-click fixes, users, devices, the audit trail, backups and the connection settings.

Both sections talk to the AgentMate server core on the server, so the server needs its core installed and you need to be signed in to it. See [Deploy servers and setup](deploy-servers-setup.md) if you have not done that yet.

## Where to find it

Click **Deploy** in the sidebar under Ship, pick a server in the rail on the left, then click **Firewall** or **Security** in the section strip above the content. You can also open them from the command palette by typing Deploy. If you are not signed in to the server's core, both sections ask you to sign in first.

## Roles and what they allow

Everyone who is signed in can read the Firewall section. Changes need more.

| Action | Role needed |
| --- | --- |
| See the firewall, rules, history and exposure | Any role (Viewer and up) |
| Make a container private from the Exposure card | Operator or higher |
| Add, edit or remove rules, turn the firewall on or off, keep or revert a change | Admin or higher |
| Security checklist and audit trail | Admin or Owner |
| Change how sshd lets people in (SSH fixes), Users tab, Backups tab | Owner |

The core checks the role again on every call, so the buttons you cannot use are hidden or disabled with a hint.

## The Firewall section

### The status card

The card at the top says **Firewall on** or **Firewall off** with a lock icon and a short sentence. If the server has neither ufw nor firewalld, it says **No firewall found**. Next to it you see these facts:

- **Backend**: ufw or firewalld (with the zone name for firewalld).
- **Incoming**: the default for incoming traffic (Allow, Deny or Reject). Admins can change it from a dropdown (**Deny by default** is the safe choice). Changing it stages a change, it does not apply it yet.
- **Outgoing**: the default for outgoing traffic.
- **IPv6**: whether IPv6 is filtered too.
- **SSH ports**: the ports sshd really listens on. The guard that protects you from lockouts uses these.

Admins also get a **Turn on** or **Turn off** button. Turning the firewall off asks you to type the server name to confirm, then stages the change for review. Warnings from the server (for example a rule the app cannot read) show under the card.

### Staged changes

Nothing you do in the Firewall section reaches the server straight away. Every add, edit, remove, default change and on/off switch is staged first. A blue bar called **N changes staged, not applied yet** lists each change in one line. You can:

- Click the small button on a line to take that change out.
- Click **Discard** to drop all of them.
- Click **Review and apply** to open the review dialog.

### The rules table

The **Rules** card lists the rules in order, because the first rule that matches decides. Each row shows the action (Allow, Deny, Reject or Limit), the ports, the protocol, the source and a comment. Hover the source to see whether the rule covers IPv4, IPv6 or both. Outgoing rules are marked "(outgoing)".

Admins (while no change is waiting for confirmation) can:

- Click **Add rule** to stage a new rule.
- Click the pencil on a row to edit it. An edit is staged as removing the old rule and adding the new one.
- Click the trash icon to stage the removal. The row stays in the list, struck through and marked "Will be removed", with a **Keep** button to take the removal back.

Rules the app cannot manage (added by hand, or firewalld services) show **Read only** with a hint explaining why.

### Add or edit a rule

The **Add a rule** (or **Edit rule**) dialog has these fields:

- **Action**: Allow (lets the traffic in), Deny (drops it without an answer), Reject (turns it away with an answer) or Limit (lets it in, but blocks an address that connects 6 times in 30 seconds).
- **Protocol**: TCP, UDP or Any.
- **Ports**: a single port such as `8080`, or a range such as `6000-6007`.
- **Source**: leave empty for anywhere, or type an address such as `203.0.113.7` or a network such as `10.0.0.0/8`. It is checked as you type.
- **Comment**: what the rule is for.

Click **Stage the rule** (or **Stage the edit**). The dialog shows an error under the form if something is invalid.

### Presets

The **Presets** card offers ready-made rules for SSH (on the ports sshd really uses), HTTP, HTTPS and common databases. Click **Stage** next to one to add its rules. A preset that is already allowed from anywhere shows **Open** instead. Database presets open the rule dialog first, with a hint that they are best kept to your own network, so you do not open a database to the whole internet.

### Review and apply

Click **Review and apply** to open **Review the firewall change**. It shows:

- A summary of the change.
- The exact commands the server will run.
- What the firewall will look like afterwards (on or off, default for incoming, number of rules) and any notes.
- A lock icon and a note if the change asks for your password again.

The dialog tells you how many seconds you will have to keep the change (60 by default). Click **Apply** to go ahead, or **Cancel**.

#### The SSH guard

If the change could cut off this computer's SSH access (for example, removing the SSH rule or turning the default to deny without allowing SSH), a red box says **This could lock this computer out of SSH** and lists the reasons. The button becomes **Apply anyway** and stays disabled until you type the phrase shown in the box. Even then, the countdown below still protects you.

### Keep or revert (the countdown)

After you apply, the change is live but on probation. A banner with a clock counts down:

- **Keep changes** opens a brand-new SSH connection to the server as a test and, if it works, makes the change permanent. A new login still getting in is the proof you are not locked out.
- **Revert** puts the old rules back right away.
- If the clock reaches zero, or the server cannot be reached, the server puts the old rules back by itself.

If keeping fails, the countdown keeps running and the server's own timer still reverts the change. People who are not Admins see the countdown and a note saying who it is waiting on. When a change ends because nobody kept it, a toast says so.

### Change history

The **Change history** card lists every change set, newest first: what it did, who made it, from which address, and how it ended (**Kept**, **Reverted**, **Rolled back: nobody kept it in time**, **Rolled back when the core restarted**, **Failed** and so on). Click a row to see the date and the exact commands it ran. A change applied by overriding the guard shows an **SSH check overridden** tag.

### Exposure

The **Exposure** card answers "what can be reached on this server?". It has two lists:

- **Listening ports**: every listening socket with its address, port, protocol, the program behind it, who can reach it (**Public**, **Private network** or **This machine only**) and what the firewall does with it (**Open**, **Some sources**, **Blocked**, **Firewall off** and so on).
- **Container ports**: every port Docker publishes. Docker publishes ports around the host firewall, so these are marked **Bypasses the firewall** when they listen on all addresses. The card explains this and suggests making them private and serving them through Websites.

#### Make private

Next to a publicly reachable container port there is a **Make private** button (Operator or higher).

- For a container that belongs to an AgentMate app, it asks for confirmation, then redeploys the app as a new revision with the service bound to `127.0.0.1`. You can follow the deploy in Apps, and when it is live the card links you to Websites to put it on a domain.
- For a container started some other way (plain `docker run`, or a compose project that was not deployed from AgentMate), a dialog shows the exact change to make where it was defined, with a **Copy the change** button.

### Cloudflare-only origin

If a server's sites sit behind Cloudflare, the Firewall section also has a **Cloudflare-only origin** card that locks ports 80 and 443 to Cloudflare's address ranges. It is described in [Cloudflare](cloudflare.md). Its changes are normal firewall change sets, so the countdown banner covers them too.

### Open the firewall fix from the checklist

The Security checklist item **Firewall on** has a **Turn on the firewall** button. It jumps to the Firewall section, stages SSH's own rules if they are missing, then stages turning the firewall on and opens the usual review. This avoids locking yourself out while enabling it.

## The Security section

The Security section is split into tabs. Which tabs you see depends on your role.

| Tab | Who sees it |
| --- | --- |
| **Checklist** | Admin, Owner |
| **Users** | Owner |
| **Devices and sessions** | Everyone |
| **Audit trail** | Admin, Owner |
| **Backups** | Owner |
| **Connection** | Everyone |

If you are not signed in to the core, you see only a sign-in card, plus (for servers you reach over SSH) a **Restore a backup over SSH** button. That is the way back when nobody can sign in to a core any more.

### The security checklist

The **Security checklist** card shows a score ring and a list of items. Each arc of the ring is one item, sized by how much it matters. The headline says how many things are left to fix, or **Nothing left to fix**. **Check again** reruns the checks. The status of each item is written as a word (**Done**, **Worth fixing**, **Needs fixing**, **Not checked**) as well as an icon.

The items are:

| Item | What it checks | Fix button |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Firewall on** | ufw or firewalld is active | **Turn on the firewall** |
| **SSH password login off** | sshd only accepts keys | **Turn off passwords** |
| **Root signs in with a key only** | PermitRootLogin does not allow passwords | **Keys only for root** |
| **Automatic security updates** | unattended-upgrades or dnf-automatic is on | **Turn on** |
| **No reboot waiting** | no installed update needs a reboot | **Open Overview** |
| **No unexpected public ports** | only SSH and web ports are reachable from anywhere | **Review in Firewall** |
| **Certificates healthy** | no certificate expired or close to ending | **Renew now** |
| **Server core up to date** | the core matches the release this app installs | **Update the core** |
| **Two-factor for every Owner** | every Owner has two-factor on | **Turn on two-factor** |

Every fix shows what it will change before it runs:

- **Automatic security updates** asks to confirm, installs the tool if it is missing and has it install security updates every day. It runs as a job you can follow in Overview.
- **Renew now** orders each certificate again from Let's Encrypt. The sites keep serving the current certificate until the new one is in. Follow the jobs in Websites.
- **Open Overview** takes you to the Overview section, where you can reboot.
- **Update the core** opens the install panel to update the core (not available for the development host).
- **Turn on two-factor** opens the two-factor dialog, see [Deploy servers and setup](deploy-servers-setup.md#two-factor-sign-in).
- Fixes need a role: SSH fixes need Owner, the others need Admin or Owner.

### SSH hardening fixes

The two SSH fixes (**Turn off passwords** and **Keys only for root**) cannot lock you out, because of how they work:

1. The **Review the SSH change** dialog shows the exact file the core writes, the commands it runs in order, and whether the core could prove that this computer signs in with a key. If key login is not proven, **Apply** stays off and the core refuses anyway.
2. After **Apply**, sshd runs the new settings but the change is on probation, with its own countdown banner: **Keep the SSH change?**
3. **Keep the change** signs in once more with the key over a new connection, under the new settings. **Revert** puts the old settings back. At zero the server puts the old settings back by itself.

Open SSH sessions stay open, only new logins get the new settings. Only an Owner can keep or revert it.

### Users, devices and sessions

The **Users**, **Devices and sessions** and sign-in parts are explained in [Deploy servers and setup](deploy-servers-setup.md#users-devices-and-sessions).

### Audit trail

The **Audit trail** tab lists every sign-in, change and refusal on the core, newest first, 50 at a time (**Load older events** shows more). Each row shows when, who (and from which computer), what, what it was done on and the result (**Succeeded**, **Refused**, **Failed**, **Cancelled**). Actions run over SSH by an administrator show as "Command over SSH".

Filters above the table:

- **Who**: a user name.
- **Action**: every action, or a group such as Sign-ins and accounts, Users, Devices and enrollment, Sessions, Package updates, Service restarts, Reboots, Jobs, Alerts, Commands over SSH.
- **Result**: any, Succeeded, Refused, Failed or Cancelled.
- **When**: any time, last hour, last 24 hours, last 7 days or last 30 days.

Two buttons sit in the card's header:

- **Check the chain**: every entry is chained to the one before it. The check tells you either that the trail is intact (all N events check out) or at which event it is broken. Someone with root on the server could still rewrite the whole file, the check shows any change short of that.
- **Export**: choose **As CSV** or **As JSON**, then pick where to save. The export respects your current filters. If more events match than one export holds, the file has the newest and a message tells you to narrow the filters.

### Backups

The **Backups** tab (Owners only) makes and restores backups of the server core.

A backup holds the core's database (users, computers, sites, certificates, settings), the keys that open what it keeps encrypted, and the apps' files. It is encrypted on the server with a passphrase you choose (AES-256-GCM, key stretched with PBKDF2), saved on your computer and deleted from the server.

#### Make a backup

1. Click **Back up now**.
2. Type a **Passphrase** of at least 12 characters, then type it again in **Passphrase again**. A hint under the fields tells you if it is too short or the two do not match.
3. Click **Choose where to save**, pick a location, and the file is saved. A toast shows the path.

> [!WARNING]
> Without the passphrase the backup cannot be opened, by you or anyone. AgentMate does not keep it. Write it down somewhere safe.

The action may ask for your password again (a step-up).

#### Restore a backup

Restoring works over SSH as root, so it also works on a brand new server once the core is installed. It is disabled for the development host, which has no SSH.

1. Click **Restore a backup** (on the Backups tab, or **Restore a backup over SSH** if you are not signed in).
2. Click **Pick the backup file** and choose the file.
3. Type the **Backup passphrase**.
4. Under **Owner in the backup**, type the user name of an Owner in the backup, and their password in **Their password**. This computer enrolls again as that Owner.
5. Optionally fill **sudo password (optional)**. Leave it empty to use the saved login password.
6. Click **Restore** and confirm by typing the server name.

The backup is checked with its passphrase before anything changes. Then the core's state is swapped for the backup, the core restarts, and you are signed in again. Steps show as they go. A core that does not come back goes back to what it had. The result says which backup was restored and where the previous state is kept on the server (root only).

> [!WARNING]
> Restoring replaces everything the core knows: users, computers, apps, sites, certificates and keys. Every session ends. Apps are not started by the restore, so deploy them again and apply in Websites so nginx serves the restored sites.

### Connection

The **Connection** tab holds the direct TLS settings that decide how this app reaches the core. See [Deploy websites and certificates](deploy-websites-certificates.md#direct-tls).

## Tips

- Always keep **Keep changes** within reach after applying. If your connection drops, the old rules return by themselves, which is the whole point.
- Stage several firewall changes and review them together, they apply as one change set.
- Use **Make private** for containers that only a website in front of them needs to reach.
- Export the audit trail before you remove the core if you need a record.
