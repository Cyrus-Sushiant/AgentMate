Terminals and agents are the heart of the [Workspace](workspace.md). An agent is an AI coding CLI, such as Claude Code or Codex, running in a terminal tab inside your project's folder. A shell is a plain terminal. You can run as many as you like, side by side, and AgentMate tells you which agents are working, which are waiting on you, and which have finished.

This page covers starting agents and shells, reading their status, the pasting and copying behavior, past conversations you can resume, and the **Fix with AI** dialog that other parts of the app use to hand a problem to an agent.

## Where to find it

Open a project in the **Workspace** (see [Workspace](workspace.md)). An empty pane shows tiles for your agents and shells. In a pane that already has tabs, click the **+** button (**New tab**) or press `Ctrl+Shift+T`.

Past conversations live in the **Agent sessions** tab of the project panel on the right (the clock icon).

## Starting an agent

### From an empty pane

An empty pane shows **Start an agent** (or **Open in this pane** in a split pane, or once the workspace has tabs). Each installed agent is a tile with its logo and name. Click one to start it in that pane.

- The installed agents get numbers (the welcome screen of an empty workspace shows up to nine tiles, a split pane shows up to six). With the pane focused and no text box active, press the number to start that agent.
- The project's own agent is marked **Project default** on the full-size welcome tiles.
- If no AI CLI is installed, the pane says **No agent CLIs installed yet** with a link, **Open the CLI manager**. Agents that are not installed show as small gray logos under **Not installed:**, and each one links to [AI CLI Manager](cli-manager.md).
- Under the tiles, **Build a prompt first** turns a rough request into a prompt and then opens it in an agent. See [Prompt Builder](prompt-builder.md).
- Below that you can open a shell, or a **Browser**.

### From the New tab menu

Click **+** in a pane's tab strip. The menu lists **Build a prompt…**, then **Agents**, **Shells**, **Browser**, **Manage CLIs** and **Keyboard shortcuts**. While the menu is open, press `1` to `9` to start the agent with that number. The default agent carries a **default** badge.

### From the keyboard

`Ctrl+1` to `Ctrl+9` start the agent at that place in the **+** menu in the focused pane. On macOS use `Cmd+1` to `Cmd+9`. Number 1 is the first agent listed, so changing the order changes which key starts which agent.

### Which agents are offered

AgentMate knows these CLIs: Claude Code CLI, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaude, Codex CLI, Grok CLI, Cursor CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, FreeBuff CLI, Qwen CLI, Aider, Goose, Cline CLI, Continue CLI and Pi. Only the ones installed on your computer show up in the launchers. Install and update them from [AI CLI Manager](cli-manager.md).

### Which agent is the default

An agent is the default for a project when you set it on the project. Otherwise it is the **Default CLI** from Settings, and failing that the CLI that matches the project's agent type. Until you choose your own order, the default agent is listed first.

### Order of the agents

In **Settings**, on the **Agents** tab, **Agent order** lists every agent. Drag a row, or use its up and down arrows, to change the order. Installed agents get the number keys 1 to 9 in that order. **Default order** resets it. See [Settings](settings.md#agent-order).

### Launch defaults: model, effort and mode

In **Settings**, on the **Agents** tab, **Launch defaults** lets you choose the model, effort and permission mode each agent starts with. Anything left on **Not set** adds no flag, so the CLI uses its own default. These apply only to workspace tabs and terminals. Background tasks such as commit messages use the Arguments box in AI CLI Manager instead. See [Settings](settings.md#launch-defaults).

When at least one launch default is set, launchers show **Alt+click: skip launch defaults**. Hold `Alt` while clicking a tile or menu item (or while pressing its number key in the menu or on an empty pane) to start the agent bare, without those flags. That tab's tooltip then says **Without launch defaults**.

### Starting from a prompt

**Build a prompt…** (`Ctrl+G` in the Workspace) opens the prompt builder for the project on screen. When you choose **Open in agent**, AgentMate opens a tab in the focused pane, starts the suggested CLI on the suggested model and effort, and types the prompt into the CLI's input box once the CLI is ready. It does not press `Enter`, so you can read it first. The tab's tooltip shows the model line, for example **Opus 5.5 · High**.

If the CLI never comes up, nothing is typed into the shell. The prompt goes to your clipboard instead and a message says **{CLI} did not come up**.

## Starting a shell

The **Shells** group in the **+** menu, and the shell buttons on an empty pane, open a plain terminal in the project folder.

- On Windows: **PowerShell**, **PowerShell 7** and **Command Prompt**.
- On macOS and Linux: zsh, bash and fish, with your default shell first.

A shell that exits cleanly (exit code 0) closes its own tab, like closing a terminal window. A shell that fails, and every agent, keeps its tab so you can still read the last output.

## Agent tabs

An agent tab shows the CLI's logo. While an agent works on a task, the tab keeps the CLI's name. When the task is done, the tab takes the task name the agent set for itself, so several agents of the same kind do not all look alike. Rename a tab yourself by double-clicking it or choosing **Rename** in its right-click menu, and your name wins.

Hover an agent tab to see its name, the CLI, the model and effort it is currently running on, its status and its folder. If you switch models in the CLI, the tooltip follows.

When a shell ends, the pane shows a bar at the bottom: **Process exited.** (or **Process exited with code {n}.**) with **Restart** and **Close**. **Restart** starts the tab again with the same command.

## Agent status

AgentMate watches every agent tab, even ones you cannot see, and keeps a status for each.

| Status | What you see | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Working | A spinning ring on the tab | The agent is busy on a task. |
| Needs your input | A pulsing amber dot, and the tab turns amber | The agent asked a question or is waiting for you to approve something. |
| Finished | A solid green dot | The agent finished, and you have not looked at it yet. |
| Idle, Exited | Nothing | Nothing needs attention. |

The status shows on the tab, on the project tile in the rail, next to **Workspace** in the sidebar, in the status bar, and in the [Running CLIs dialog](workspace.md#running-clis). Status comes from the terminal output and, for Claude Code, from hooks that AgentMate adds when it starts the agent.

### Notifications for agents

When an agent finishes or asks something while you are in another tab, page or app, AgentMate shows a system notification such as **Claude Code CLI needs your input** or **Claude Code CLI finished**, naming the project and tab. A question outranks a finished run when several arrive together. Clicking the notification opens that tab. No notification is shown for a tab you are looking at.

Turn this on or off with **Workspace notifications** in **Settings**, on the **General** tab (it is on by default). See [Settings](settings.md#workspace-notifications). You can also have the desktop pet announce agent status, see [Widgets and the desktop pet](widgets-desktop-pet.md).

### Terminal AI notifications

A separate setting, **Terminal AI notifications**, covers AI tasks started from the terminal drawer's SSH sessions and from Remote Desktop sessions. When such a task wants to run a command, asks you a question, needs a password, or pauses on an error while that terminal is hidden or you are in another app, you get a system notification. It is on by default. See [Remote](remote.md), [Remote Desktop](remote-desktop.md) and [Settings](settings.md#terminal-ai-notifications).

## Auto-continue

Agents stop when they hit a usage limit or lose their connection. Auto-continue types **continue** into the agent for you, so a long task picks itself back up.

Click the play button in the pane header (**Auto-continue**), or right-click an agent tab, to turn on either or both:

- **After the usage limit resets.** AgentMate waits for the reset time the agent printed, plus a short grace period, then sends **continue**.
- **After a network error.** For internet, DNS or connection drops. AgentMate sends **continue** after 3 minutes, and waits longer each time it fails again (5, 10, 15, then 20 minutes).

The switches are per tab, and they only show for a running agent. When a **continue** is scheduled, the button shows a pulsing dot, its tooltip tells you the time (for example **Usage limit hit. Sending "continue" at 3:05 PM**), and a **Cancel this time** button (**Cancel scheduled continue** in the tab menu) cancels that one attempt.

## Terminal appearance

- With **Workspace terminal background** off, a terminal follows the app theme the way an ordinary terminal would. The VS Code Dark and VS 2026 themes bring their own matching palettes.
- With it on, every pane terminal gets your color, and the text colors adjust to stay readable. See [Workspace](workspace.md#workspace-terminal-background).
- Terminals keep the last 5,000 lines of scrollback. Colors that a program picks itself are lightened or darkened when they would be too hard to read.

## Copy and paste

| You do this | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C`) with text selected | Copies the selection. |
| `Ctrl+C` with nothing selected | Sends an interrupt to the program, as usual. |
| `Ctrl+V`, `Cmd+V` or `Shift+Insert` | Pastes the clipboard. |
| Right-click | Copies the selection if there is one, and otherwise pastes. |
| `Shift+Enter` | Inserts a new line in an agent's prompt instead of sending it. |

If a program asks for mouse events (Claude Code's full-screen mode does), right-click goes to the program, which pastes by itself. Use `Shift`+right-click to paste from AgentMate in that case.

### Pasted images and copied files

You can paste a screenshot straight into an agent. AgentMate saves the image to a file in its own folder and types the file's path, quoted for your shell. Agents such as Claude Code and Codex attach an image when they are given its path. These saved images are cleaned up after about a week.

Files you copy in File Explorer or Finder and paste (or drag onto a terminal pane) arrive the same way, as quoted paths. Drop a file on a pane and you see **Drop to paste the file path**.

When the shell is sitting at a fresh prompt, each pasted file shows as a short chip such as `[Pasted #1]` instead of a long path, and the real path is sent when you press `Enter`. If the shell is not ready for that, the full paths are pasted as plain text.

### Image previews

When an agent such as Claude Code shows an `[Image #1]` label for a pasted picture, hover the label to see a preview of the image. Click the preview, or `Ctrl+click` (`Cmd+click` on macOS) the label, to open the image at full size. The viewer starts fitted to the window. Click the image to switch to actual size and back, or click **Open in default app**.

## Links

`Ctrl+click` (`Cmd+click` on macOS) a web address in a terminal to open it in your system browser. A plain click only selects text.

## Right-to-left text

Persian, Arabic and Hebrew text is drawn right to left, with letters joined the way they should be, instead of reversed and spaced out as terminals usually show it. English words inside a right-to-left line keep their place. Claude Code reorders right-to-left text itself before it prints it, so AgentMate lays out Claude Code's lines left to right to avoid reversing them twice.

## Sending files and comments to an agent

Several features hand text to a running agent: **Add to {agent}** in the file explorer's right-click menu ([Files and editor](workspace-files-editor.md)), and comments you leave on a web page ([Browser and tests](workspace-browser-tests.md)). They all follow the same rules.

- The text is typed into the agent's input box and never submitted. Read it, then press `Enter`.
- The agent that gets it is the one in the focused pane, otherwise the one you last typed in, otherwise one visible in another pane, otherwise the newest agent.
- If no agent is running, the project's default CLI is started and gets the text when it is ready.
- If the agent is not accepting input, the text goes to your clipboard and a message says so.

## Agent sessions

The **Agent sessions** tab lists past Claude Code and Codex conversations that were started in this project's folder, newest first, under **Today**, **Yesterday**, **This week**, **This month** and **Older**.

- Click a conversation to resume it in a new tab (`claude --resume` or `codex resume`, with your usual launch defaults). The tab's tooltip starts with **Resumed:** and the conversation's title.
- A conversation that is already running in a tab shows an **Open** badge. Clicking it jumps to that tab instead of starting a second one.
- Hover a row for **Copy conversation id** and **Resume in a new tab**, and for details such as the first and last prompt, the model and effort it ran on, and the git branch.
- **Search conversations** filters by title, prompt, branch, model or id. When both Claude and Codex conversations exist, an **All / Claude / Codex** switch appears.
- Runs started by tools (such as `claude -p`) are hidden. Click **Show {n} runs started by tools** to include them.
- The refresh button in the panel's tab strip (**Refresh sessions**) reloads the list. It also updates on its own every 20 seconds.
- With none yet, the tab says **No conversations yet**.

An agent tab whose shell did not survive AgentMate closing (a reboot or a crash) resumes its conversation by itself when you come back, for Claude Code and Codex tabs that had a conversation going.

## Fix with AI

Many places in the app have a **Fix with AI** button: failed pipeline runs, failing tests, merge conflicts and pull request review comments. They all open the same dialog.

1. The left side shows the **Prompt** the agent will get, already written from the failure. It is editable.
2. The right side, **Recommended run**, sizes the prompt (**Light task**, **Moderate task** or **Complex task**) and suggests a model and effort. You can change both. **Why** explains the pick, **Copy command** copies the launch command, and **Size the prompt again** re-runs the sizing after you edit the prompt.
3. Click the main button at the bottom right: **Run on {model · effort}**, or **Open in {CLI}** when there is no suggestion (it reads **Open in {CLI} (sizing…)** while the sizing runs). A second button, **Open in {your default CLI}**, appears when the suggested CLI differs from your default.
4. AgentMate opens a tab in the focused pane, starts the CLI on those settings, and types the prompt for you to send with `Enter`. A message says **Starting {CLI}**.

**Copy prompt** at the bottom left copies the text without starting anything. While the failure is still being fetched, the dialog shows a loading line, and if it cannot be read you get **Try again**.

For where each button lives, see [Git in the Workspace](workspace-git.md) (conflicts, review comments, failed checks) and [Browser and tests](workspace-browser-tests.md) (failing tests).

## Tips

- Start the same task in two agents, each in its own pane, and compare. For separate branches, use a worktree each, see [Worktrees](worktrees.md).
- If an agent seems stuck on a question, look for the amber tab. The status bar and the sidebar dot show it too.
- Set **Launch defaults** once, so every new Claude Code or Codex tab starts on your favorite model and effort.
- Put your most-used agent first in **Agent order**, and `Ctrl+1` always starts it.
