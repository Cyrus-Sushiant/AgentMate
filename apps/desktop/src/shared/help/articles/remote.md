The Remote page is where you reach other computers. It has four tabs: **Host** (let another AgentMate or the mobile app control this computer), **Connect** (control another AgentMate), **SSH** (saved servers you open in a terminal tab) and **Remote Desktop** (saved Windows machines you open in their own window).

Two sets of tools live here. The first is an AnyDesk-style remote control that works between AgentMate installs on the same network, and from the AgentMate mobile app. The second is a saved server list for SSH and Remote Desktop.

## Where to find it

Click **Remote** in the sidebar under **Connect**, or open the command palette and type Remote. Pick a tab at the top: **Host**, **Connect**, **SSH** or **Remote Desktop**.

Below the tabs, two shared cards can appear on any tab: **File transfers** (progress of files being sent or received, shown once a transfer starts) and **Activity** (a running log of what happened, such as pairing attempts and connections, with timestamps).

## Host: let another device control this computer

Use the **Host** tab on the computer you want to be controlled. The card **Allow this machine to be controlled** starts a small server on one of your network addresses.

### Start hosting

1. Open the **Host** tab.
2. In **Network address**, pick the IP address to host on. The first one (a local network address when there is one) is selected for you. The list shows each address with its network name.
3. Check **Port**. The default is 7900 and it must be between 1024 and 65535.
4. Click **Start hosting**. A green badge shows "Listening on (address):(port)". Click **Stop hosting** to shut it down. You cannot change the address or port while hosting. Controllers see your primary screen.

> [!NOTE]
> Keyboard and mouse control of the host is only available when the host runs Windows. On other systems, a yellow note says controllers can see the screen but cannot drive it. Screen viewing, clipboard and file transfer still work.

### Create a pairing code

Once hosting, a **Pairing code** card appears.

1. Click **Generate pairing code**. A QR code and a text code (starting with `AGENTMATE1:`) appear.
2. Give the code to the other device: scan the QR with the AgentMate mobile app, or copy the text with **Copy code** and paste it on the other computer.
3. Click **New code** whenever you need a fresh one.

Each code works once and expires after 5 minutes. Generating a new code cancels the old one. A device that paired successfully is remembered by the host, so it can reconnect later without a new code. Stopping and starting hosting does not forget paired devices.

### Connected controllers

The **Connected controllers** card lists each device that is connected, with its name and address. When at least one device is connected you also get:

- **Send clipboard.** Sends this computer's clipboard text to the connected device.
- **Send file.** Opens a file picker and sends the file to the connected device.
- A quality badge next to the Start/Stop button (Excellent, Good, Fair or Poor) with the current speed and round trip time in milliseconds.

While someone is connected, AgentMate keeps the host's display from going to sleep.

## Connect: control another AgentMate

Use the **Connect** tab on the computer you are sitting at.

### Pair with a new device

1. On the other computer, start hosting and generate a pairing code (see above).
2. In the **Pair a new device** card, paste the code into **Pairing code**.
3. Click **Connect** to control the machine. A remote window opens with the other screen. Or click **Connect (files only)** to skip the control session and just browse and transfer files (see [Remote files](remote-files.md)).

If the code is empty, a toast says "Paste a pairing code first." Errors such as an expired code show under the box. After the first successful connection, the computer is saved.

### Saved servers

Computers you have paired before are listed in **Saved servers**, with their address and when you last connected. Reconnect with one click, no code needed.

- **Connect.** Opens the remote control window.
- **Browse files.** Connects for files only, then opens the file manager.
- **Pencil or the name.** Click the name to rename it. Press `Enter` to save or `Escape` to cancel.
- **Forget** (trash icon). Removes the saved computer after you confirm. You can pair again later with a fresh code.

### While connected

When a connection is active, the Connect tab shows a status card with the device name and a **Connected** or **Connecting...** badge.

- **Show remote window** brings the control window to the front (or **Open file manager** for a files-only connection).
- **Disconnect** ends the connection.

### The remote control window

Controlling another computer happens in its own window, separate from the main app. It has:

- A header with the device name, a connection badge (Connected, Connecting..., Failed or Disconnected) and the remote screen size.
- **Clipboard** (send your clipboard text to the other computer) and **Send file**.
- A quality badge (Excellent, Good, Fair or Poor) with speed, round trip time and frames per second, plus a small bandwidth graph.
- The remote screen itself. Click it to focus it. Your mouse, scroll wheel and keyboard are sent to the other computer. Text you copy on the remote side that it sends back is placed on your clipboard.
- A red error bar if the connection failed. Closing the window ends the session.

The picture is sent as video when possible, and falls back to image tiles if the video connection cannot be set up. The quality is adjusted automatically to your network.

## SSH: saved servers

The **SSH** tab keeps a list of servers you connect to over SSH. Clicking **Connect** opens a new SSH tab in the terminal drawer at the bottom of the app, already logged in.

### Add a server

1. Click **Add server** (in the card header or in the empty state "No servers yet").
2. Fill in **Nickname** (for example "Production box"), **Host**, **Port** (default 22) and **Username**.
3. Pick the sign-in method with the switch **Password** or **Private key**.
   - **Password:** type it in **Password**.
   - **Private key:** set **Private key file** (type a path such as `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or use **Browse**) and, only if the key itself is protected, **Key passphrase**.
4. Click **Add server**, or press `Ctrl+Enter` (`Cmd+Enter` on macOS) to save.

To change a server later, click the pencil on its row. Leave the password or passphrase blank to keep the saved one. Switching between password and key drops the old secret.

Each row shows `user@host:port`, the sign-in method and when you last connected. The buttons on a row are:

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **AI history on this server** (clock icon) | Opens a side sheet with the Claude Code and Codex conversations stored on that server. |
| **Connect** | Opens an SSH terminal tab for the server. |
| **Edit this server** | Opens the edit form. |
| **Remove this server** | Removes it after you confirm. You can add it again with the same details. |

### The servers passkey

By default, saved passwords and key passphrases are protected by your operating system's keychain. You can add a **passkey** on top of that, which is shared by saved SSH servers, saved Remote Desktop servers and project environment secrets.

- **Protect with a passkey** sets one. You type it twice. If you forget it, those secrets cannot be recovered.
- With a passkey set, the vault starts locked each session. **Unlock vault** asks for the passkey, and a green **Vault unlocked** badge shows when it is open. Connecting to a server, or reading its history, asks you to unlock first.
- The key icon changes the passkey. The lock icon removes it, after which secrets go back to keychain-only protection.

> [!NOTE]
> This passkey is separate from the master password of the [Vault](vault.md) page. The Vault is a password manager. The passkey only protects saved server passwords and project environment secrets.

### Host key prompts

The first time you connect to a server, AgentMate saves its host key fingerprint. If the key later changes, AgentMate stops and shows a dialog titled "(name)'s identity changed" with the **Trusted before** and **Presented now** fingerprints. A changed key is normal after a reinstall, but it can also mean someone is intercepting the connection. Compare it with your hosting provider (on the server, `ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub` prints the fingerprint). Then choose:

- **Don't connect** (the default, safe choice).
- **Trust the new key** to save it and connect.

### AI history on a server

The clock button opens a sheet named after the server. It lists the conversations Claude Code and Codex have stored on that machine, grouped by folder and day. Search them, filter by tool, show or hide background runs, and click one to resume it in a new SSH tab (AgentMate changes into that folder and runs the tool's resume command). The server is asked only when you open the sheet or click **Refresh**. If a tool is not installed on the server, a warning chip says so.

### Ask AI in an SSH terminal

Inside an SSH terminal tab, the terminal bar has a robot button that lets an AI work on the server for you in one of three modes: **Approve each command**, **Auto, guard risky ones** or **Fully autonomous**. See [Workspace terminals and agents](workspace-terminals-agents.md).

## Remote Desktop: saved Windows servers

The **Remote Desktop** tab keeps saved Windows servers and PCs. **Connect** opens the session in its own window. Adding a server, the session window, file copying and Ask AI are covered in [Remote Desktop](remote-desktop.md).

## The AgentMate mobile app

AgentMate has a companion app for iPhone and Android that works as a remote control for a computer running AgentMate. It is controller only: you control your computer from the phone. You cannot host from the phone, and sending files is not available on mobile yet.

### Pair your phone

1. Your phone and the computer must be on the same Wi-Fi network.
2. On the computer, open **Remote**, **Host**, start hosting and click **Generate pairing code**.
3. On the phone, open the app. Tap **Scan QR** and point the camera at the code, or paste the `AGENTMATE1:...` code into the box under **Pair a new computer** and tap **Connect**.
4. You only pair once. The computer is saved under **My computers** on the phone. Tap it to reconnect later. Tap the pencil next to it to rename it (**Save**) or remove it (**Forget**).

### Using the phone as a remote

Once connected, the computer's screen fills the phone.

- Tap to click. Long-press for a right click. Drag with one finger to drag.
- Pinch to zoom, and drag with two fingers to pan while zoomed. With two fingers moving up or down while not zoomed, you scroll.
- The floating **...** button opens a bar with the computer name and screen size, **Stats** (connection details), **Clipboard** (sends your phone's clipboard to the computer) and **Disconnect**.
- A keyboard bar gives you the system keyboard plus Esc, Tab, Enter, Backspace and the arrow keys. Clipboard text the computer sends with **Send clipboard** on the Host tab is copied to the phone.

## Tips

- Remote control is for computers you own or are allowed to control. Only the person at the host can create a pairing code, and only for 5 minutes.
- If a connection feels slow, check the quality badge. Fair or Poor usually means a weak Wi-Fi link.
- A computer you paired once stays paired after you restart AgentMate, so you do not need a new code each time.
