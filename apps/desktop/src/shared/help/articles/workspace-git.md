The Source control panel sits on the right of the [Workspace](workspace.md) and shows what your agents are changing in the project, as it happens. From it you can look at each diff, stage files or single lines, write a commit message (with AI if you like), commit and push, switch branches, open and merge a pull request, and fix merge conflicts.

Everything here works on the project folder on screen. If that is a worktree, it works on the worktree's own branch, see [Worktrees](worktrees.md).

## Where to find it

Open a project in the **Workspace**. The right panel opens on **Source control** (the branch icon). Its tabs are **Source control**, **Explorer**, **Agent sessions** and **Tests**. A number on the **Source control** icon counts changed files (or failing checks on your pull request, which take priority and turn it red).

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+G` (`Cmd+Shift+G` on macOS) to hide or show the panel. When it is hidden, a narrow strip with the tab icons stays on the right. Click an icon to bring the panel back on that tab.
- Drag the panel's left edge to resize it, between 240 and 560 pixels wide. Double-click the edge to go back to the default width.

If the folder is not a git repository, the panel says **Not a git repository** and offers **Open the Git tab**, which opens the project page where you can set one up (see [Projects](projects.md)).

## The branch bar

The strip at the top of **Source control** shows:

- The current branch name (or `detached` and the commit when you are not on a branch). Click it to jump to the **Branches** section. Its tooltip tells you what the branch is tracking.
- A pull request pill next to it. **#42** with a colored dot shows the branch's pull request and its state. **Create PR** appears once the branch is published and has no pull request yet. Click either to open the **Pull request** section.
- One main button for what is needed now: **Publish** (the branch is not on the remote yet), **Push** (you have commits to send), **Pull** (the remote has new commits), or **Sync** (both, which pulls and then pushes). Arrows show how many commits are behind and ahead. When nothing is needed, only the fetch button shows.
- **Fetch from remote** (the circular arrows) updates what AgentMate knows about the remote without changing your files. AgentMate fetches once by itself when the panel first shows, so the counts mean something.
- **Show line totals** (the small chart icon) turns the line totals on and off, described below.

If the project has no remote, the sync buttons are not shown.

When a merge, rebase or similar operation is stopped half way, a banner says **{operation} in progress** with **Fix with AI** (when conflicts are the problem) and **Abort**. **Abort** asks first, then puts the repository back to how it was before the operation started.

## Sections of Source control

Under the branch bar, the tab is a stack of sections that fold open and closed: **Changes**, **Branches**, **Worktrees**, **Commits**, **Pull request** and **Pipelines**. Only **Changes** is open at first. Click a section's title to fold it, and open as many as you like. Each header can show a count: changed files, worktrees, unpushed commits, or pull request items that need you (red when checks fail). Drag the thin splitter between two open sections to change how much room each gets, and double-click it to reset.

## Changes

**Changes** lists every changed file in groups: **Conflicts** (only during a merge problem), **Staged changes**, **Unstaged changes** and **Untracked**. Each group header shows a count and folds away. Hover a header for its bulk buttons.

| Group | Header buttons |
| --- | --- |
| **Staged changes** | **Unstage all** |
| **Unstaged changes** | **Discard all changes**, **Stage all** |
| **Untracked** | **Delete all untracked files**, **Stage all** |

If you have more than 2,000 untracked files, only the first 2,000 are listed and a warning suggests a missing `.gitignore` entry. When nothing has changed, the panel says **Working tree clean** and that files your agents change will show up the moment they are written.

### Rows

Each row shows the file name, its folder, how many lines were added and removed, and a status letter: **M** modified, **A** added, **D** deleted, **R** renamed, **C** copied, **T** type changed, **!** conflict, **U** untracked (new).

- Click a row to open its diff in a preview tab. Double-click, or press `Enter`, to keep the tab open.
- Hover a row for its buttons: **Open file**, **Stage** (or **Unstage**), **Discard changes** (**Delete file** for untracked files). In the conflicts group you get **Mark as resolved** and the conflict buttons described below.
- Move with `Up` and `Down`. Press `Space` to stage or unstage the row, and `Delete` to discard it.
- Discards and deletes show a message with **Undo**, so a mistake is recoverable right away. Discarding or deleting a whole group asks first.

### Right-click menu of a row

**Open Changes**, **Open File**, **Open With Default App**, **Reveal in File Explorer** (or the Finder or folder equivalent), **Reveal in Explorer View**, **Copy Path**, **Copy Relative Path**, then **Stage** or **Unstage**, **Discard Changes** (**Delete File** for untracked files), and for conflicts **Resolve with AI** and **Mark as Resolved**.

### Line totals

With **Show line totals** on, a summary above the list shows how many files changed and how many lines were added and removed, with a small bar like GitHub's. Click it to see the same numbers per group. Binary files and files too large to read have no line counts and are left out.

## Writing a commit

When there are changes, a commit box sits at the top of **Changes**.

1. Type a message in **Commit message**, or click the sparkle button (**Write a commit message with AI**) and let your AI CLI write it. The box shimmers while it works, and you can click the button again (**Stop writing**) to cancel. Edit the result however you like.
2. Click **Commit**. It commits what is staged. If nothing is staged, the button reads **Stage all & commit** and stages everything first.
3. To commit and push in one go, click the arrow next to the button (**More commit options**) and choose **Commit & push**. For a branch that has no remote copy yet, this publishes it.

`Ctrl+Enter` (`Cmd+Enter`) commits and `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` commits and pushes, while you are typing in the message box. A message you have half written is kept for each project, even if you switch tabs or pages, until you close AgentMate.

The commit button stays off while the message is empty, while there is nothing to commit, and while conflicts are unresolved. With conflicts the box says **Resolve the conflicts below before committing.** and shows **Fix with AI**.

### AI commit messages

The sparkle button writes from the staged changes, or from every change when nothing is staged. How it writes is set in **Settings**, on the **Agents** tab, under **Commit messages**:

- **Written by**: which AI CLI writes the message. Left empty it uses the project's CLI, then your default.
- **Longest summary line**: from 40 to 120 characters, 72 by default.
- **Style**: **Conventional Commits**, **Plain summary**, **Summary and bullet points**, or **My own instructions**.
- **Extra instructions (optional)**, or **Your instructions** for the custom style. For example, "Mention the ticket id from the branch name."
- **Allow a body**: lets the message have a short explanation under the summary. It is hidden for the bullet-points style.

See [Settings](settings.md#commit-messages).

## Diffs

Opening a changed file shows its diff in a tab in the focused pane. The tab's header names the file and its side (**Staged**, **Working tree**, **New file** or **Conflict**, or **Commit {id}** for a past commit).

- **Previous change** and **Next change** (`F7` and `Shift+F7`) jump between changed blocks.
- **Show side by side** or **Show inline** switches the layout, and **Hide whitespace changes** ignores whitespace-only edits.
- **Keep this tab open** pins a preview tab, and **Open file** opens the file in the editor.
- For a working tree change, the right side is the real file. Edit it in place and click **Save** (or `Ctrl+S`). An **Unsaved** marker shows until you do. Staged content and old commits are read-only.
- **Stage**, **Unstage**, **Discard changes** and **Mark resolved** act on the whole file.
- To stage, unstage or discard only some lines, select them in the diff and use the small action that appears, or the right-click items such as **Stage Selected Lines**. Save your edits first, or it asks you to.
- If a file is no longer changed, the tab says so and offers **Show staged** or **Show working tree** when the other side still has changes.
- Pictures show a **Before** and **After** view (**Added** or **Deleted** when only one exists). A binary file says **Binary file**, and a huge one says it is too large to diff.

## Branches

Open the **Branches** section to see local branches, then remote-only ones under **Remote**. The current branch has a check mark and is bold, and the default branch is tagged **default**.

- **Switch**: click a branch. If you have uncommitted changes, AgentMate asks **Switch to {branch}?** first. Git carries your changes over when it can, and refuses (and says why) when they would be overwritten.
- **Create**: click **New branch** (the **+** in the section header), type a name (spaces become dashes), and press `Enter`. The new branch is created from where you are and you switch to it.
- **Find**: with more than eight branches, a **Filter branches** box appears.
- **Open on GitHub**: double-click a branch. A branch that is not pushed yet says so.
- **Delete**: hover a branch and click **Delete branch**. Remote-only branches say **Delete remote branch** and are removed from the remote for everyone, after a confirmation. The current branch, the default branch and `master` cannot be deleted here.
- **Branches held by a worktree**: git keeps a branch checked out in only one place. A branch in another worktree or the main checkout is tagged **in worktree** or **in main checkout**, and clicking it opens that workspace instead. Other branches have **Open in a new worktree**. See [Worktrees](worktrees.md).

## Commits

**Commits** lists the latest 100 commits on the branch with a line of history down the side. Commits that are not pushed yet have a hollow dot and the label **not pushed**. Each shows its message, short id, author, how long ago it was made, and any tags.

- Click a commit to expand its files, then click a file to see that commit's diff.
- Hover a commit and click **Copy commit id**.

## Conflicts

When a merge, rebase or similar operation leaves conflicts, the **Conflicts** group lists the files, the commit box is blocked, and the count on the **Changes** header turns red.

### Resolve a file by hand

Hover a conflicted row for **Ours** (**Keep your version**) and **Theirs** (**Keep the incoming version**), which take one side whole. Or open the file, edit out the conflict markers, then click **Mark as resolved** (or **Mark resolved** in its diff tab). Click **Abort** in the banner to cancel the whole operation.

### Resolve a file with AI

Click **Resolve with AI** (the sparkle on the row, or in the diff tab header). Your AI CLI reads both sides and writes the merged file in the background. Nothing is staged, so you can review the result. The row shimmers while it works, and clicking the spinner (**Stop resolving with AI**) cancels and puts the file back. When it is done a message gives the CLI's summary with an **Undo** button. If it fails you see **AI could not resolve the conflict**. **Stage** and the side-picking buttons are off for that file while the AI is working.

### Fix all conflicts with AI

**Fix with AI** (in the banner, or beside the conflict notice in the commit box) opens a dialog with one prompt that lists every conflicted file. It works like every **Fix with AI** dialog: you review the prompt, pick a model and effort, and the agent opens in a tab with the prompt typed, ready for `Enter`. See [Terminals and agents](workspace-terminals-agents.md#fix-with-ai).

## Pull requests

The **Pull request** section walks the current branch from no pull request, through checks and review, to merge. It uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`). A refresh button reloads it, and **Open in a larger view** shows the same cards in a big dialog with review on one side and checks and merge on the other.

### Before you start

The section tells you what is missing instead of failing quietly.

- **No remote**: add a GitHub remote and publish the branch.
- **GitHub CLI not found**: install `gh`. The **Open Agent Tools** button goes to [Agent tools](agent-tools.md).
- **No GitHub remote**: the repository is not hosted on GitHub.
- **Sign in to GitHub**: click **Run gh auth login**. A terminal opens with the command typed, ready for `Enter`.
- On the default branch, it says **Pull requests start from a branch** and offers **New branch**.

### Create a pull request

With no pull request yet:

1. Check the branches at the top. The base is the repository's default branch, and you can pick another from the list.
2. If you have uncommitted changes, a note says they are not part of the pull request until you commit them, with a **Review changes** button.
3. Type a **Title** and an optional description. The sparkle button (**Write the title and description with AI**) drafts both from your changes. Click it again to stop.
4. Tick **Open as a draft** if you want one.
5. Click **Create pull request**. The branch is published or pushed first when needed, and a message offers **Open on GitHub**. If `gh` is not available, AgentMate opens GitHub's own pull request page in your browser.

After you publish a branch with **Publish** or **Commit & push**, a message offers **Create pull request** too, as long as GitHub is set up for the project.

### Follow an open pull request

The section shows the pull request's number, title, state (**Open**, **Draft**, **Merged**, **Closed**), branches and size, with a button to open it on GitHub, then three cards that fold. Cards that need attention start open.

- **Checks** lists each check, failures first. Click one to open it on GitHub. For a failed GitHub Actions check, **Fix with AI** hands the failure to an agent, and **Copy error** copies it. See [Pipelines](pipelines.md) for the all-projects view.
- **Review** shows the review decision (**Approved**, **Changes requested**, **Review required**) and open review threads. Each thread shows the file and line, and you can **Reply** or **Resolve** (**Unresolve**) it. **Show {n} resolved** reveals the finished ones.
- **Merge** is the last step, described below.

The review card also has:

- **Fix comments with AI**, which builds a prompt from the open threads and opens the **Fix with AI** dialog.
- **Review with AI**: your project's CLI reads the pull request's diff without changing files and writes a review. You can edit it, then click **Post as comment**.
- A comment box. Click **Post comment** or press `Ctrl+Enter`. Above it are one-click review commands, which fill the box with a request for a review bot. The defaults are `@claude review`, `/gemini review`, `@coderabbitai review` and `@codex review`. Edit the list in **Settings**, on the **Agents** tab, under **Review commands**. Type a command, click **Add**, remove one with its **x**, or click **Reset to defaults**. See [Settings](settings.md#review-commands).

### Merge

The **Merge** card lists what is in the way, or says **Ready to merge into {base}.**

- Things GitHub will always refuse stop the button: the pull request is closed or merged, it is still a draft (a **Mark ready** button fixes that), it conflicts with the base, or you have uncommitted changes while cleanup is on.
- Softer warnings, such as failed or running checks, a reviewer who asked for changes, an approval still needed, or open threads, do not stop you. The confirmation then says GitHub still refuses the merge if the repository requires them, and its button reads **Merge anyway**.
- The arrow beside the button (**Choose merge method**) picks **Squash and merge** (the default), **Create a merge commit** or **Rebase and merge**. Your choice is remembered per project.
- **Delete {branch} here and on GitHub, then switch to {base}** is ticked by default. After the merge, AgentMate switches to the base branch, pulls the merge and deletes the branch locally and on GitHub. Each step is listed. If a step fails, **Retry cleanup** tries again.
- A confirmation dialog spells out what will happen before anything runs.

If the pull request was merged elsewhere and you are still on its branch, a card says **Merged into {base}** with a button to switch and delete the branch. A closed one offers a new pull request. A summary, **Merged #{n} into {base}**, stays on screen after the merge until you dismiss it.

## Pipelines

The **Pipelines** section lists each GitHub Actions workflow of the repository with its latest run, failures first. Click a row to open the run on GitHub. A failed run has **Fix with AI** and **Copy error** buttons. It needs `gh` installed and signed in, and shows the same notices as the pull request section if not. For a list across all your projects, see [Pipelines](pipelines.md).

## Worktrees section

The **Worktrees** section lists the project's worktrees, with a **New worktree** button in its header. Everything about it is in [Worktrees](worktrees.md).

## Tips

- Keep **Changes** open beside a running agent. Click the first row and watch diffs arrive.
- Stage only the lines you want from a messy diff, and let the agent's other edits wait for the next commit.
- Set **Style** in **Commit messages** once, and every AI message follows your team's convention.
- Use **Commit & push** on a new branch to publish it and get the **Create pull request** prompt in one go.
