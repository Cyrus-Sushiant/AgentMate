AgentMate can leave the main window and live on your desktop. Floating glass widgets show your token usage or give you a small Build Prompt box. The AI pet is a character that walks around your screen, tells you about your token usage and speaks up when something happens. This article also covers the **Keep computer awake** control in the status bar.

## Where to find it

- **Pet:** **Settings**, then the **AI Pet** tab (`/settings?tab=companion`).
- **Usage widgets:** the **Token Usage** page. Click the pin button (**Add to desktop**) on a provider card or on the all-agents chart.
- **Build Prompt widget:** the pin button in the **Build Prompt** dialog (**Add to desktop**).
- **Keep computer awake:** the status bar at the bottom of the AgentMate window.

## Desktop widgets for token usage

A usage widget is a small frameless window with a frosted glass look that stays on your desktop. It shows one provider's token usage (or plan limits) or the all-agents chart.

### Add a usage widget to the desktop

1. Open **Token Usage** from the main menu.
2. On the provider's card, click the pin button (tooltip **Add to desktop**). The all-agents chart at the top has its own pin button. If the card can show plan limits, first switch it with the toggle (**Show plan limits** or **Show tokens and cost**), because the widget pins whichever view is showing.
3. The **Add to desktop** dialog shows a live preview. Adjust the options below.
4. Click **Add to desktop**. A message says the widget was added.

The options, which are the same in the dialog and in the widget's own settings:

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Period** | **Day**, **Week** or **Month**, the range the headline numbers use. |
| **Background blur** | How frosted the glass is, from 0% to 100%. |
| **Background color** | **Theme** (follows the app theme), **Ink**, **Slate**, **Navy**, **Forest**, **Wine**, **Sand**, **Frost**, or any custom color from the color picker. |
| **Always on top** | On, the widget stays above other windows. Off, it sits on the desktop behind other windows and comes back when you show the desktop. |
| **Size** | **S**, **M** or **L**. |
| **Style** | **Color** or **Mono**. |

### Use and move a widget

- Drag the strip along the top of a widget to move it. You can also resize it by its edges. Its position and size are remembered, and widgets come back when AgentMate starts.
- Hover over a widget to reveal the buttons at the top right. The gear (**Widget settings**) opens the same options as above, with **Remove from desktop** at the bottom, and a second button switches between tokens and plan limits when the provider has both.
- The figures refresh every minute. Click the **Period** chips on the widget to change the range.
- Several widgets can be open at once, including more than one for the same provider (tokens and plan limits side by side).

### Build Prompt widget

The Build Prompt widget is a small always-on-top window for turning a request into a good prompt without opening AgentMate.

1. Open the **Build Prompt** dialog for a project (from the Workspace or the Projects page).
2. Click the pin button (**Add to desktop**) at the top right of the dialog. It is hidden while the dialog is maximized.
3. The widget opens on your desktop with the project name in its title: **Build Prompt · Project name**.

In the widget, type **Your request**, choose a **Type** and **Target**, then click **Generate** (or **Translate** to turn the request into English). The result appears under **Generated prompt**, with **Copy** and **Save draft** (the draft is saved to the project). The prompt builder shortcuts work inside it, see [Keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.md#prompt-builder). Close it with the **x** at the top right. It comes back when AgentMate starts, until you close it. See [Prompt Builder](prompt-builder.md).

## The AI pet

### Turn the pet on

1. Open **Settings**, **AI Pet**.
2. Turn on **Show my AI pet** in the **My AI Pet** card.

The pet appears on your main display, above other windows, and the rest of your desktop stays clickable around it. Turn the switch off to remove it.

### Pick a character and name it

The **Character** card lists the built-in pets: **Claude**, **Gremlin**, **OpenCode**, **Tide** (the default), **Pip**, **Brick**, **Ember**, **Nori**, **Bolt**, **Moss**, **Cocoa** and **Hex**. Click one to switch.

To use your own picture:

1. Click **Add your pet** and choose a PNG, GIF or WebP file (up to 8 MB). An animated GIF or WebP gives you an animated pet.
2. The pet is named after the file and selected right away. AgentMate keeps its own copy, so you can move or delete the original.
3. To remove one, click the trash button on its tile and confirm. This deletes AgentMate's copy only, and if it was the active pet the default comes back.

Under the characters, **Name** gives your pet a name of your own (up to 24 characters). It appears on the stats card, in the right-click menu and on anything the pet says. Leave it empty to keep the character's name. **Flip walking direction** fixes a character that walks backwards, and is saved for that character only.

### What you can do with the pet

| Action | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Click it | The pet hops and a small card opens next to it with **Tokens**, **System** and **Network** tabs. Click again, or **Close**, to dismiss it. |
| Double-click it | Brings up AgentMate. If the pet is still showing a failed pipeline, it opens that run instead. |
| Drag it | Places it anywhere on the screen. |
| Right-click it | Opens its menu. |

The three tabs of the card:

- **Tokens**: today's token count and cost, 7-day and 30-day totals, a small chart and your top three agents. If no sources are connected it points you to Token Usage.
- **System**: CPU, memory, GPU and disk activity.
- **Network**: download and upload speed with a small chart, plus whether your ping targets answer and how fast. The targets come from Settings, **Network**, **Network ping targets**.

The right-click menu has **Open AgentMate** (or **Open the failed run**), **Stop moving** / **Start moving again**, **Hide for** 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour or 3 hours, and **Turn the pet off**. While it is hidden, **Settings**, **AI Pet** says until when and offers **Show now**.

### Motion, speed and size

- **Motion**: **Wander the screen** (off keeps it still), **Can climb to the top** (a rope drops, it climbs, walks the top edge and comes back down), **Come down with a parachute** (floats down instead of rappelling) and **3D rope and parachute** (shaded gear for a pet you uploaded as a 3D render). The last two need climbing on.
- **Action speed**: separate sliders for **Walking**, **Climbing**, **Rappelling** and **Parachute**, from 40% to 200% (100% is the usual pace).
- **Size**: **Display size** from 50% to 160%, and **Click area** from 40% to 100%. Turn the click area down when your picture has empty space around the character, so clicks and the card follow the smaller area.

### What the pet says

The **Alerts** card has four switches, all of which need the pet to be on:

- **Tell me when a pipeline fails** and **Tell me when a pipeline passes**, for GitHub Actions runs you watch. A bubble for a failed run opens that run in Pipelines when you click it.
- **Tell me when internet quality changes**, when the connection drops, comes back, or clearly gets better or worse.
- **Tell me when a CLI needs input or finishes**, for Workspace terminals you are not looking at.

A speech bubble disappears on its own after a few seconds, or when you click it. The pet can also speak a project's **Desktop companion** hook, see [Notifications and Telegram](notifications-telegram.md#project-hooks).

## Keep computer awake

The status bar at the bottom of the window has a **Keep computer awake** control, shown as a mug with the current mode and a dot that is filled while the computer is being held awake. Click it to choose:

- **On**: keep this computer awake continuously.
- **Agent** (the default): stay awake while an agent or a command is running.
- **Off**: allow normal sleep.

In **Agent** mode the panel says what is holding the computer awake, such as an agent at work, a command in a terminal or an SSH session. The screen can still turn off, only sleep is held back. This also keeps the app from being slowed down while it is in the background.

## Tips

- If a widget or the pet seems to be hidden behind another window, turn **Always on top** on for a widget, or toggle the pet off and on. The pet puts itself back on top of other windows every few seconds on its own.
- Use **Hide for** when you are presenting. The pet returns by itself.
- Widgets are separate windows. They do not appear in the taskbar, so use the gear on the widget to change or remove it.
