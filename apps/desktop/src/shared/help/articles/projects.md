A project in AgentMate is a folder on your computer that you work on with AI agents. The Projects page lists them all so you can search, pin, reorder and open them. Each project then has its own page with everything about it in one place: a standing prompt for agents, a Blueprint that turns an idea into a plan, drafts and scheduled prompts, git tools, security scans, dependency updates, Docker containers, scaffolding files for your agent, skills, MCP servers, notification hooks and saved environment files.

## Where to find it

Click **Projects** in the menu, or press `Ctrl+P` (`Cmd+P` on macOS) from any page except the Workspace (there, `Ctrl+P` opens file search). You can also open the command palette and type a project's name, or click **New Project** on the Dashboard. A project's own page is at `/projects/<id>`, and the section you are on is kept in the address (for example `?tab=git`), so going back and forward lands you in the same place.

## The Projects page

The page header reads "Projects", with the line "Open a workspace, pin favorites, or archive what you are done with." Click a card or row to open that project's page.

### Search, filter and view

- The search box at the top ("Search projects…") matches names, descriptions, folder paths and tags. Press `/` anywhere on the page to jump to it, and `Esc` to clear it. A count such as "5 projects", or "2 of 5" while filtering, sits beside it.
- When your projects use more than one agent type, a row of chips filters by agent: **All agents** plus one chip per type that exists, such as Claude Code or Codex.
- The **Archived** button (with a count) appears once you have archived something. It switches the page to the archived projects. Click it again to go back. Search and the agent filter work on whichever set is on screen.
- The two buttons beside it switch between **Grid view** and **List view**. AgentMate remembers the choice.

### Pinned, all and archived

Pinned projects get their own **Pinned** section at the top, and the rest follow under **All projects** (or **Matches** while a search or filter is on, or **Archived** in the archived view). Pinned projects have an accent bar on their left edge.

### Reorder projects

Hover a card or row and drag it by the grip icon (**Drag to reorder**) to put it before or after another one in the same group. A pinned project stays among the pinned ones. Reordering is turned off while a search or agent filter is active or while you are viewing archived projects, and the grip is greyed out with a tooltip saying to clear the filter.

### What a card shows and does

Each project card or row shows its icon, name, "Updated ..." time, description, an agent badge, up to three tags (with a "+N" for more), and links. The icons on the card:

- **Pin to top** or **Unpin project**, and **Archive project** or **Restore project**, appear on hover. Archiving moves a project out of the way without deleting it.
- The agent badge (for example Claude Code) opens that agent's CLI in a terminal in the project folder. Generic projects have no CLI, so their badge does nothing.
- The folder link opens the project folder in your file manager. The globe and branch icons open its website and its repository.
- **Run** starts the project's run command in a terminal. If the project has several commands it opens a **Run command** dialog to pick one. If it has none, a message says to set one and the project page opens. See [Run commands](#run-commands).
- A small group of three icon buttons: **Open the Git section** (the project's Git tab), **Review with diffray** (the review wizard) and **Build a prompt for this project** (the Build Prompt dialog).

An empty list shows "No projects yet" with a **New Project** button. If a search matches nothing, the page says so and offers **Clear filters**.

## Create or edit a project

Click **New Project** (on the Projects page or the Dashboard). The same dialog is used for **Edit project** on a project's page. It has three tabs, and you can fill in only the first and come back to the rest later.

1. Click **New Project**.
2. On the **Basics** tab, enter a **Name** and choose a **Folder**. Both are required.
3. Add anything else you want on the three tabs.
4. Click **Create project**, or press `Ctrl+Enter` (`Cmd+Enter`). When editing, the button reads **Save changes**.

Until the name and folder are filled in, the button is disabled and the footer says "Name and folder are required".

### Basics tab

| Field | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | The project's name. |
| **Folder** | Where the project lives. Paste a path or click **Browse**. Terminals and agents start in this folder. Picking a folder fills in the name from the folder name if the name is empty. |
| **Git repository** | Where the code is hosted. Paste a public GitHub link (`github.com/owner/repo`) to clone it into the folder on Create — the dialog says "Will clone into …". The folder must be empty (an existing repo is kept as-is). A failed clone still creates the project with the link, and the error tells you why. Private repos need `gh auth login` first. An **Open** button opens the link. Fetch and pull afterwards from the project's Git tab. |
| **Tags** | Press `Enter` or comma to add a tag. Backspace in the empty box removes the last one. Tags are used by search and filtering. |
| **Description** | One line about what the project is. |

### Appearance tab

- **Icon**: click the tile to choose an image, or drop an image on it. **Choose image** and **Remove** buttons do the same. PNG or SVG looks best. Large images are scaled down for you. With no image, the project shows a folder glyph.
- **Tile color**: the square behind the icon. Pick a swatch, the theme default, or the pencil swatch for any other color with its opacity.
- **Glyph color**: the color of the folder mark. It only appears while there is no image.
- **Website**: the project's site. When you leave the field and there is no icon yet, AgentMate fetches the site's favicon as the icon. **Use favicon** does it on demand and tells you if none was found.

### Agent tab

- **Agent type**: how AgentMate talks to this project's assistant. The choices are Claude Code, Gemini, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor and Generic. The type decides which files Bootstrap creates and which CLI the agent badge opens.
- **AI CLI**: which CLI runs helper tasks such as tag suggestions and version bumps. **App default (from Settings)** follows Settings, Agents, **Default CLI**.
- **Run commands**: see below.
- **Notes**: free text for anything worth remembering, such as where credentials live.

### Run commands

Run commands are what the **Run** button executes in the project folder. The list has three columns: **Order**, **Environment** and **Command**. Give each command a short name in **Environment** (for example `dev`) and the command itself (for example `npm run dev`). Click **Add command** to add more, and the trash button to remove one.

The order matters. **Run** lists the commands top to bottom, and a project with one command runs it straight away. Drag a row by its grip to reorder, or focus the grip and use the arrow keys.

When you click **Run**, AgentMate opens a terminal in the project folder, types the command and runs it, and shows a message such as `Running "dev".` The status bar then shows the run with its port, CPU and memory, and `Shift+F5` stops the run in the drawer (or the newest run). See [Interface tour](interface-tour.md).

## A project's page

The page has a header, a section list on the left (a tab bar on narrow windows) and the section's content on the right.

### Header

- **Projects** at the top left goes back to the list.
- The project's icon, name and description, then badges: the agent (click to open that CLI in a terminal here), **Archived** if it is archived, and its tags.
- The folder path. Click it to copy the path ("Path copied to clipboard."). Beside it, **Open in File Explorer** and **Open terminal here**, and links to the website and repository if set.
- **Run** appears when the project has a run command.
- **Open workspace** opens this project in the [Workspace](workspace.md).
- **Prompt** opens the standing prompt editor. See [Overview](#overview).
- The **More project actions** menu has **Edit project**, **Set a run command** (when there is none), **Open folder**, **Open terminal**, **Archive project** or **Restore project**, and **Remove project**. Removing asks first and only removes the project from AgentMate: your files on disk are kept.

### Sections

The list on the left has two groups. **Work**: Overview, Blueprint, Prompts, Git, Review, Security, Packages, Docker, Terminal. **Setup**: Bootstrap, Skills, MCP, Hooks, Environments, Config. At the bottom of the list, **Created** and **Updated** show when the project was added and last changed.

Small badges flag things that need a look: Prompts shows open drafts plus missed scheduled prompts (amber when any was missed), Skills and MCP show how many are installed (Skills turns amber when updates are available), and Security shows how many critical and high findings the last scan found. **Review** only appears once the diffray tool is installed (see [Agent Tools](agent-tools.md)).

### Overview

The Overview section has the project's standing prompt and its notes.

- **Standing prompt** is context agents should start from every time they work on this project: stack, conventions, constraints. Click **Define prompt** (or **Edit prompt**) to open the **Project prompt** editor. It is a Markdown editor with a word and character count. **Copy** copies it, **Clear** empties it, and **Save prompt** stores it. The header's **Prompt** button opens the same editor.
- **Notes** is a scratchpad for things you do not want in the standing prompt. Use **Add notes** or **Edit notes**, then **Save notes**.
- If the diffray tool is installed, a **Review with diffray** card opens the Review section.

### Blueprint

Blueprint turns an idea into a plan. You describe the project in six steps, then AgentMate writes a ready-to-use prompt that tells an agent to act as a Product Manager and produce the planning documents for it. It is a section of the page, not a dialog, because you will come back to it over days.

The step rail across the top has **Idea** (what you are building), **Architecture** (structure and stack), **Backend** (services and data), **Frontend** (UI and client), **CI/CD** (build and release), **Quality** (testing and standards) and **Review** (write the prompt). Every step can be opened in any order and a tick marks the ones with text. Buttons at the bottom, named after the previous and next step, move along. Steps save on their own when you click away.

#### Write a step

1. Open a step. A Markdown editor with live preview opens, with a hint in the box about what to cover.
2. Write in plain Markdown. Persian is fine, and the generated prompt comes out in English either way.
3. Use the preset chips above the editor to add ready-made snippets. Clicking a chip appends its text. If a step has no presets, a link takes you to Settings. You can edit presets under Settings, General, **Blueprint presets**.
4. Click **Attach files**, or paste or drop onto the editor, to add images, video or other files. They land where the caret is, up to 25 MB each. Under the editor, each file can be inserted again (**Insert**), opened outside AgentMate, renamed (click its name) or deleted. A file that is not used in the text is marked "not in the text".
5. Leave **Include this in** ticked (the box names the project's agent file, such as AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md) to copy this step into that file in the project. Ticked steps go into one managed block, so repeating it never duplicates anything.
6. Click **History** to see every saved version of the step and **Restore this version** to bring one back. A restore is saved as a new version, so nothing is lost.

#### Generate the prompt

1. Fill in at least one step, then open the **Review** step.
2. Set **Docs folder**, the folder (relative to the project root) where the agent should write the plan. The default is `docs`.
3. Turn **Confirm before writing files** on if you want the agent to list its planned phases and epics and wait for your yes before writing anything.
4. Click **Generate prompt** (it reads **Regenerate prompt** once one exists). Use the arrow beside it to choose who writes the prompt under **Generate with**: a CLI, a model and an effort level (**Written by**, **Model**, **Effort**), or the AI provider from Settings. The choice is remembered for the project. Steps written in Persian are translated first.
5. Read and edit the prompt in the editor. **Save prompt** stores your edits.

The prompt asks the agent to write a product brief, a roadmap with phases, one file per epic, a backlog of tasks, milestones and a risk list inside the docs folder.

Under the editor you can **Copy** the prompt, **Save as draft** (it appears in the project's Prompts section under Drafts), **Use as standing prompt**, or **Run in CLI**. **Run in CLI** asks for the model and effort, then opens the agent in a Workspace tab with the prompt typed in. Press `Enter` there to run it. The **History** button on this step lists earlier versions of the prompt.

### Prompts

The Prompts section keeps every prompt for the project in one place. Three views switch with the buttons at the top, and a search box ("Search prompts…") filters the list:

- **History** shows everything together: prompts you generated or translated, drafts and scheduled prompts, grouped by day.
- **Drafts** holds prompts you have not finished. Open drafts are listed under **In progress**, and finished ones are hidden behind **Show N implemented**.
- **Scheduled** holds prompts ready to run. They are grouped as **Needs attention** (missed), **Up next** and **Done**.

Click **New prompt** to write one (or **New draft** or **Schedule a prompt** from an empty view). **Prompt Builder** opens the Prompt Builder page. In the **New prompt** dialog, **Save as** is **Draft** (still writing it) or **Scheduled** (ready to run). A scheduled prompt also has:

- **Run**: **Manually** (when you press Run) or **Automatically** (at a set time, using **Run at**). Automatic runs open a new terminal tab in the project folder. AgentMate has to be running at that time, otherwise the prompt is marked **Missed**. Give a missed prompt a new time to put it back in the queue.
- The CLI, model and effort to run it with.

Each entry has icons: **Copy prompt**, **Delete**, and depending on its kind **Move to another project**, **Edit**, **Schedule it** (for a draft), **Mark implemented** and **Reopen draft**, **Run now** or **Run again**, and **Cancel**. History entries can show the original input you typed with **Show original input**, and a draft can be edited in place (`Ctrl+Enter` saves). See also [Scheduled tasks](scheduled-tasks.md).

### Git

The Git section is a full set of everyday git tools for the project's folder. See [Git in the Workspace](workspace-git.md) for the Workspace version.

If the folder is not a repository, the section says so and offers **Initialize repository**. The setup wizard then walks through two steps:

1. **Set up git for this project**: choose the **Initial branch** (default `master`), and whether to commit the files already in the folder (**Commit the files that are already in the folder**, with a **Commit message**, default "Initial commit"). Click **Initialize repository**.
2. **Connect this project to GitHub**: with the GitHub CLI installed and signed in, choose an **Owner** (your account or an organization) and a **Repository name**, click **Check**, then **Connect and push** (or **Create repository and push** if it does not exist yet, with an optional description and a private or public choice). **Connect over SSH instead of HTTPS** is available. Without the GitHub CLI you can use **Use a remote URL instead** and paste a remote address. A final step says what was pushed and links to the repository.

In an existing repository the top of the section shows:

- A branch picker (search to switch branches, and remote-only branches can be checked out) and a **Branch chart and history** button.
- Badges: **In sync**, **N ahead**, **N behind**, **No remote**, and **Clean** or **N changed files**.
- **Fetch**, **Pull**, **Push** and **Sync** (the one that matters most for the current state is highlighted). With no remote, **Connect to GitHub** replaces Sync. **Review with diffray** appears when that tool is installed.

Below the top row:

- **Changed files**: every changed file with a status badge (modified, added, deleted, renamed or untracked).
- **Branches**: type a **New branch** name (or **Suggest with AI**, which uses your CLI to propose one from your changes) and click **Create**. **Default branch** lets you choose which remote branch is the default (it must exist on the remote, and GitHub is updated when the GitHub CLI is signed in), then **Set default**. **All branches** lists every branch with badges (**current**, **default**, **remote**), a history button, and a menu with **History**, **Rename** and **Delete**. Rename can also rename the remote branch, and Delete can delete the remote branch and delete an unmerged branch.
- **Commit changes**: a **Commit message** box with **Suggest with AI** and **Commit all changes**.
- **Version tag**: shows the latest tag and how many commits are after it, with **Tag a version**. See [Tag a version](#tag-a-version).
- **Pull request**: **Create pull request** pushes the branch and opens a pull request with the GitHub CLI, or the compare page in your browser if it is not installed. The dialog asks for a **Title**, a **Base branch** and a **Description**, and its button is **Create Pull Request**.
- **GitHub Actions**: when the project has a GitHub remote, each workflow in the repository is listed with its latest run (**Passing**, **Failed**, **Running**, **Queued** and so on). The switch on each row decides whether you are notified about its failures. Icons run a workflow now (when it supports manual runs), stop a running one, copy a failed run's error and open the run on GitHub.
- **Worktrees**: what a new worktree of this project starts with. **Setup command** runs in its own terminal tab in every new worktree, and **Its own files to copy** overrides the app-wide patterns for this project. See [Worktrees](worktrees.md).

The branch history dialog, **Branch history**, shows an activity chart for the last 12 weeks and the commits on the branch with a graph, authors, tags and a short hash you can click to copy.

### Review

The Review section runs diffray, a multi-agent code reviewer, over the project. It only shows once diffray is installed from Agent Tools. It needs a git repository: otherwise it points you to the Git section. A wizard has four steps:

1. **Diffs** (what to scan): **Working tree** (uncommitted changes, or the last commit if clean), **Compare to a branch** (pick a **Base branch**), **Last N commits** (a **Commit count** from 1 to 50, with presets), **Changed files** (tick files, and optionally review whole files rather than just the diff), or **Whole codebase** (every source file, with a **Folder**, **Include tests** and **Files per pass**, and a note that large trees cost real tokens).
2. **Agents** (who looks): **Quality**, **Bugs**, **Security**, **Performance** and **Consistency**. **Select all** or **Clear** change them together.
3. **Engine** (which AI): pick the CLI that runs the agents (**Claude Code**, **Cursor Agent**, **OpenCode** or **Codex**), a **Model**, and a **Severity filter**. Switches: **Skip validation** (faster, more false positives), **Stream progress**, and **Save findings as JSON** with a **Report file** name. **Compare models** shows a table of speed, quality and cost.
4. **Launch** (run the review): shows the exact command or commands. **Write .diffray.json** saves your choices for later runs. Click **Run review**. The command is typed into a terminal in the project folder but not run until you press `Enter`.

The review wizard can also be opened as a dialog from a project card (**Review with diffray**).

### Security

The Security section scans the project with security tools and gives one merged report. Scanners are installed from Agent Tools (when none is installed, a **Browse security tools** button goes there), and the section is never hidden so you can see what exists.

| Scanner | What it covers | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Semgrep** | Pattern-based static analysis across many languages. A good first scan. | 1 to 5 minutes |
| **Trivy** | Known CVEs in dependencies, hardcoded secrets, infrastructure-as-code problems. | 1 to 3 minutes |
| **Bearer** | Data-flow analysis that follows sensitive data through the code. | 2 to 10 minutes |
| **SonarQube** | Vulnerabilities and security hotspots, with history on its own dashboard. | 5 to 20 minutes |
| **CodeQL** | Deep analysis tracing untrusted input to dangerous code. Slow, finds real paths. | 10 to 45 minutes |
| **Strix** | An autonomous agent that runs your code and proves vulnerabilities. Costs tokens on your own API key. | 15 to 60 minutes |

1. Tick the scanners you want. Each card says **Ready** (with its version) or why it cannot run, with an **Install** or **Set up** button. **Refresh scanner status** re-checks.
2. Click **Run scan**. Progress shows per scanner, with its output behind a toggle and a **Cancel** button. You can leave the tab while it runs.
3. Read the report.

Setup is per project: Semgrep needs a **Ruleset**, CodeQL needs a **Language** (with **Detect**) and, for compiled languages, a **Build command**, SonarQube needs a **Server URL**, **Project key** and **Token**, and Strix needs a **Model** and **LLM API key**. These are stored in this computer's settings file and removed from reports and logs.

Strix asks for confirmation (**Run it**) before every run because it executes your code in a sandbox and spends tokens.

The report shows a verdict (**Nothing serious found**, **Worth a look**, **Needs attention** or **Fix before shipping**), a score out of 100, a bar of severities, the findings grouped from **Critical** down to **Info**, and per-scanner status. Filter by severity or scanner, or search by file or rule. Click a finding to see its code excerpt, a suggested fix, and CWE, OWASP or CVE tags. Secrets that were matched are masked.

**Copy report** has three formats: **AI fix prompt** (worst findings first, ready to paste at an agent), **Markdown report** and **Raw JSON**. Each finding also has its own copy button. **History** reopens earlier scans. The scanner output for each run is available at the bottom of the report.

### Packages

The Packages section lists the dependencies of the project and which are outdated. It reads `package.json` with npm, Yarn or pnpm, `pubspec.yaml` for Dart and Flutter, and .NET project files for NuGet. If it finds none it says so and offers **Scan again**.

- The top shows the number of packages, how many are outdated (or **All current**) and the ecosystems found, with a **Refresh** button.
- **Search packages** and the filters **All**, **Outdated** and **Dev** narrow the lists.
- Each ecosystem has its own block. Each row shows the name, **Dev**, **Not installed** or **Latest unknown** badges where they apply, the current and latest version and whether the change is major, minor or patch.
- Click **Update** on a row, or tick rows (or **Select N outdated**) and click **Update N**, to update them. A progress line shows "Updating 2 of 5", and rows show a tick or a warning.
- **Copy** gives an **AI update prompt** (versions and steps, ready to paste at an agent) or just the **Package names**, for the selected packages or for all outdated ones.

If the package manager is not installed, the block says so.

### Docker

The Docker section lists containers started with `docker compose` from this exact project folder. Start, stop, restart and remove them, or **Stop all** when several are running. If Docker is not installed or not on the PATH, it says so. If there are no containers it explains how to start them. The full container manager is the [Docker](docker.md) page.

### Terminal

The Terminal section opens a shell in the project folder. **Open terminal here** opens it in the terminal drawer, **Run** (or **Run** followed by the command, if there is only one) starts the project, and **Set a run command** opens Edit project on the run commands when there are none. Terminals already open for this project are listed under **Open here** with a **Show** button. Hiding the drawer does not stop the shell.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap creates the files and folders an AI agent expects, following that agent's own documented layout. It never overwrites a file that already exists.

The section previews **Files it will create** and **Folders it will create**, based on the project's agent type:

- Claude Code: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, rules, agents, skills and commands folders and a review command.
- Gemini: `GEMINI.md`, `.gemini/settings.json` and a review command.
- Codex: `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/config.toml` and a skills folder.
- OpenCode: `AGENTS.md`, `opencode.json`, and agent and command folders.
- Cursor: `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc` and commands.
- Generic: `AGENTS.md`.

Every type also gets an `.agentmate` folder with `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and `TASKS.md`.

1. Open **Bootstrap** and review the preview.
2. Click **Bootstrap Project**.
3. In the dialog titled **Describe** followed by the project name, write what the project does. The text fills the Overview part of the files, and is saved on the project. Leave it empty to use default template files.
4. If you wrote in Persian, click **Translate & continue**, review the English, edit if needed and click **Bootstrap project**. The translation is also saved to your prompt history.
5. A result list shows each file as created or already existing.

Below the plan, **Browse and edit project files** is a small file browser for the project folder. Click a folder to enter it, **.. up** to go back, and a file to edit it. Markdown files open in a rich editor, with **Markdown** and **Text** buttons to switch, and other files open in a code editor. Click **Save**. Switching files with unsaved changes asks before discarding them.

### Skills

The Skills section lists skills installed into this project, with their version and the result of any safety check. Each row has a **Check** button (scan the skill for unsafe instructions), **Update** when a newer version exists, and **Remove**. **Check all** checks them all, and the **Deep review with an agent CLI** switch adds a second opinion from an installed CLI (slower, and it can only make a verdict stricter). Skills that came with the repository rather than through AgentMate are listed under **Also in this project** and can be checked too. **Browse marketplace** opens the Skills page for this project. See [Skills](skills.md).

### MCP

The MCP section lists MCP servers installed into this project with a **Remove** button for each. **Browse marketplace** opens the MCP Servers page for this project. See [MCP Servers](mcp-servers.md).

### Hooks

Hooks send a notification when an agent in this project finishes or needs you. There are three independent cards: **Completion** (a Telegram message when the agent finishes), **Confirmation** (a Telegram message when it needs your confirmation, and your reply is forwarded to the project's open terminal) and **Desktop companion** (the desktop pet speaks the message).

For each card, turn the switch on, choose the **Installed agent**, edit the message (use `{{project}}` for the project name), and click **Save**. **Send test** (or **Preview on pet**) tries it. With Claude Code the hook is wired into `.claude/settings.json` automatically. For other agents AgentMate generates a script at `.agentmate/hooks/notify-<kind>.cjs` that you wire into the agent yourself. The Telegram cards need a bot set up in Settings, **Notifications**. The pet card needs the desktop companion turned on. See [Notifications and Telegram](notifications-telegram.md) and [Widgets and desktop pet](widgets-desktop-pet.md).

**Other hooks** lists hooks found in the project's `.claude/settings.json` and `settings.local.json` that AgentMate did not create. Edit one (**Matcher** and the JSON body) or delete it.

### Environments

The Environments section keeps this project's env files and logins for each stage in one place, stored encrypted on this computer and included in a password-protected backup.

- **Add environment** creates a stage: Development, Test, Staging, Production, or **Custom...** with a name such as QA or Demo.
- **Import from folder** copies the `.env` files in the project root into AgentMate. It guesses each file's stage, lets you choose the target environment, skips files over 1 MB and never changes the files in the folder.
- Select an environment from the list. Its **Env files** card has **Add file** (paste or type the contents) and icons to edit, copy the contents, write it back to the project folder and delete it. Writing a file to the folder asks before replacing one that exists, and warns if the file is not in `.gitignore`.
- Its **Credentials** card has **Add credential** (a label, username, URL or host, password, token or key, and notes) with icons to open the URL, copy the password, edit and delete.
- **Protect with a passkey** encrypts saved passwords and environment secrets with a passkey instead of only the OS keychain. When set, **Unlock vault** is needed before using them, and you can change or remove the passkey.

Deleting an environment removes its saved files and credentials from AgentMate only.

### Config

The Config section edits `.agentmate/config.json` in the project folder in a JSON editor. Click **Save** to write it. It refuses invalid JSON.

## Tag a version

Tagging a version creates a git tag (for example `v1.4.0`) on the current commit and pushes it if the repository has a remote. It is in the Git section (**Tag a version**) and also in the Workspace header (the **Tag a version** button, with a tag icon).

1. Click **Tag a version**. The dialog shows the **Latest** tag and the **Next** one, and how many commits came since.
2. Choose a version. **Patch** (fixes only), **Minor** (new features) and **Major** (breaking changes) fill in the next number. Or click **Suggest with AI**, which reads the commits since the latest tag with your CLI and proposes a version and tag message. You can also type a **Version** yourself.
3. The **Prefix** (default `v`) names the tag series. If the repository uses several prefixes, **Prefixes in use** switches between them. AgentMate remembers the prefix per project.
4. Add a **Tag message (optional)**.
5. Optionally click **Update version in files**, described below.
6. Click **Create & push tag** (or **Create tag** when there is no remote).

The dialog warns if the tag already exists, if there are uncommitted files that will not be part of the tag, and if the version you typed is not in `major.minor.patch` form (it is created exactly as typed).

### Update version in files

**Update version in files** runs your CLI over the repository to set the new version in `package.json`, other manifests and version strings. It takes minutes, you can close the dialog and keep working, and a notification tells you when it is done.

You then review every changed file. For each file you can **Keep** or **Revert** the whole file, or open it and keep or revert single lines or blocks (shift-click to choose a range). **Keep the rest** and **Revert the rest** finish quickly. A file marked **Had edits** already had uncommitted changes of yours. When every file is decided, click **Commit N kept files**. Tagging stays locked until the version bump is committed, because the tag goes on the last commit. If you create the tag before committing the bump, a warning explains that the tag would carry the old version. **Back to tag** returns to the tag dialog.

## The Build Prompt dialog

Build Prompt turns a rough request into a clear prompt for a project. Open it from the **Build a prompt for this project** button on a project card. In the Workspace, `Ctrl+G` opens it for the project on screen. Your request and result are remembered per project, and Generate and Translate keep running if you close the dialog.

1. Choose a **Type** and a **Target** AI. See [Prompt Builder](prompt-builder.md) for what they mean.
2. Type your request in **Your request**, or click **Dictate** to speak it. Persian is fine, and the prompt comes out in English.
3. Click **Generate prompt** (`Ctrl+G` or `Ctrl+Enter`). **Translate** (`Ctrl+T`) rewrites your request in English without generating a prompt. **Cancel** stops either.
4. Use **Copy** (`Ctrl+C`, ignored while text is selected) or edit the result.
5. Click **Save draft** to keep it in the project's Prompts section, **Open in** (or **Run on**) an agent to open the agent in the Workspace with the prompt typed in (press `Enter` there to run it), or the arrow for other agents and **Add scheduled task**.

A chip above the result can size the prompt and suggest a model and effort, in which case the button reads **Run on** that model. **History** goes to the project's Prompts section. **Maximize** enlarges the dialog, and **Add to desktop** pins a small Build Prompt widget for that project to your desktop. See [Widgets and desktop pet](widgets-desktop-pet.md).

## Tips

- Pin the two or three projects you use most so they stay at the top.
- Give each project a distinct tile color. It is easier to spot in the list and in notifications.
- Put several run commands on a project (for example `dev` and `test`) and drag the one you use most to the top.
- Use the standing prompt for rules every task needs, and the Blueprint for a one-off plan.
- If a project's folder moved, open **Edit project** and set the new **Folder**.
