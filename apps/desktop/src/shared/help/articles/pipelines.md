Pipelines is one page that lists the recent GitHub Actions runs of every project you have added to AgentMate. You can filter by status or repo, open a run on GitHub, cancel a run that is still going, and copy a failure to paste at an agent. The same page also holds your inbox of unread results, which is why the old `/notifications` address now redirects here.

AgentMate reads runs through the GitHub CLI (`gh`), so the page only fills up once `gh` is installed and signed in.

## Where to find it

Click **Pipelines** in the sidebar under **Ship**, or open the command palette and type Pipelines. When there are unread failures, a red count badge appears next to **Pipelines** in the sidebar (and on the **Ship** menu when you have switched navigation to the top menu bar in Settings).

## Getting started: GitHub CLI and sign-in

Pipelines shows a short hint instead of the run list until three things are true.

1. The GitHub CLI is installed. If it is not, the page says "Install the GitHub CLI to see your Actions history here." with a link to cli.github.com.
2. You are signed in. If not, click the **gh auth login** link in the hint. AgentMate opens a terminal titled "GitHub login" with `gh auth login` already typed. Press `Enter` in that terminal and follow the prompts.
3. At least one project has a GitHub remote. Otherwise the page says "Add a GitHub remote on a project and its Actions runs show up here."

If GitHub cannot be reached (a network hiccup, DNS or a rate limit), the page says "Could not load runs from GitHub." Hover the text to see the exact error, then click **Try again**.

> [!NOTE]
> Only projects whose folder has a GitHub remote show up, and archived projects are skipped.

## The run list

Each run is a card with a colored stripe on the left (red for failed, green for passed, amber for running or queued, yellow for passed with warnings, gray for the rest).

- **Title and status badge.** The run title (or the workflow name) and a badge: Queued, Running, Passed, Passed with warnings, Failed, Timed out, Cancelled or Skipped.
- **New badge.** A red **New** badge and a red outline mean AgentMate raised an unread failure notice for that run.
- **Details line.** The repo, workflow name, branch, run number (for example #42), how long the run took, and how long ago it was updated.
- **Click the card** to open the run on GitHub in your browser. If the run had an unread notice, clicking it marks that notice as read.
- **Open project button** (folder icon on the right). Opens the project's Git tab. It only appears for runs that belong to a project in AgentMate.

At the bottom, a line such as "Showing 12 of 30 runs across 4 repos" tells you how much the filters are hiding. The list refreshes by itself about once a minute.

### Filter, search and refresh

Above the list you have:

- **Status tabs.** **All**, **Running** (includes queued), **Passed**, **Failed** (includes timed out) and **Cancelled** (includes skipped and other endings). Each tab shows a count.
- **Search runs.** Type words and every word has to match somewhere in the run title, workflow name, repo, project name, branch or run number (for example `#42`).
- **All repos.** A dropdown to show only one repo. It can be cleared.
- **Clear.** Appears when any filter is active and resets all of them.
- **Mark all read.** Appears when you have unread notices and marks every one of them as read.
- **Refresh runs** (the circular arrow). Asks GitHub again for the runs and the runner status. If a refresh fails, the last list that loaded stays on screen and a small bell appears on the button. Hover the button for the reason and when the list was last saved.

If your filters hide every run, the page says "No runs match these filters" and shows how many runs were loaded.

## Run actions

### Stop a run

Runs that are still queued or running have a **Stop** button.

1. Click **Stop** on the run card.
2. Confirm **Stop run** in the dialog. Jobs that already finished stay as they are.
3. AgentMate asks GitHub to cancel the run and shows "Asked GitHub to stop that run." The card updates to Cancelled after a few seconds.

### Copy the failure

Failed runs have a **Copy error** button. It gathers the failure details and the relevant log text from GitHub and copies them to your clipboard, ready to paste into an agent terminal. A toast confirms "Error copied to clipboard."

### Annotations

When you scroll a finished run into view, AgentMate looks up its annotations (the errors, warnings and notices GitHub attaches to a run). A strip under the card summarizes them, for example "2 errors · 1 warning". Click the strip to expand the list.

- Each annotation shows its message, the job name and the file location (path and line range) when there is one.
- **Copy this annotation** copies a single one.
- **Copy all** copies every annotation of the run with a header.

A run that passed but left warnings is shown as **Passed with warnings** in yellow. It still counts under the **Passed** tab. Failed runs keep their red color whatever else they left.

## Self-hosted runners panel

If your repos use self-hosted runners, a **Self-hosted runners** panel appears above the filters. People who only use GitHub-hosted runners never see it.

- **Summary chips** show how many runners are idle, busy, offline and "seen", plus how many jobs are waiting.
- **Runner tiles** show the runner name, its OS and architecture, the repo or org it belongs to, its custom labels and its state. Busy runners come first, offline ones last.
  - **Busy.** Shows the workflow and job it is running. Click it to jump to that run in the list.
  - **Idle** and **Offline.**
  - **Live status unknown** (shown as "Last job ... ago"). GitHub only reports live status for organization runners to org admins, so for others AgentMate can only tell when the runner last ran a job.
- **Waiting job alerts.** When jobs are queued for a runner label that no online runner matches, a yellow alert says how many are waiting and for which labels. Click it (**Show job** or **Show oldest**) to jump to the oldest one.
- **Show all** and **Show fewer.** With more than eight runners the grid shows eight and offers a toggle.
- **Hide runners** (chevron button). Collapses the panel. AgentMate remembers your choice.

### Grant org admin access

For organization runners, the panel can show "Live status for (org) runners needs org admin access." with two buttons.

1. Click **Grant access**. A terminal titled "GitHub org access" opens with `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:org` typed in. Press `Enter` and approve the new scope in your browser. You also need to be an admin of the org.
2. Back in AgentMate, click **Check again** to ask GitHub for the runner list again.
3. Click the X on the hint to hide it for that org.

## Notifications and the unread badge

AgentMate checks your watched workflows about every 45 seconds while the app is open. When a workflow finishes after you started watching it:

- A failed or timed out run creates an **unread** notice, counts toward the badge on **Pipelines**, and shows up as a toast message.
- A passed run creates a notice too, but it is saved as already read, so it never raises the badge.
- Notices are kept up to a limit of 200, newest first.

If you turned on the desktop pet's pipeline messages in Settings, the pet also speaks when a run fails or passes, and clicking the pet's bubble opens that run on this page and highlights it with a blinking ring. See [Widgets and desktop pet](widgets-desktop-pet.md).

Other notices land in the same inbox: updates for CLI tools and alerts from Deploy servers. Notices that have no run to attach to appear above the run list, each with a **New** badge. Click one to mark it read and open the page it belongs to.

> [!TIP]
> To stop getting notices for one workflow, open the project's Git tab and use **Stop watching this pipeline** on that workflow. **Watch this pipeline again** turns it back on and only reports runs from that moment on. See [Workspace: Git](workspace-git.md).

## Tips

- The GitHub activity card on the [Dashboard](dashboard.md) shows the same runs in a smaller form.
- If a run you were pointed to is missing, it has dropped off the recent list and AgentMate says so in a toast.
- Pull requests, their checks and merging live in the project's Git tab, not on this page. See [Workspace: Git](workspace-git.md).
