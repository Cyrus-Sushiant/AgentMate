The Cloudflare page manages your domains on Cloudflare without leaving AgentMate. You connect it once with an API token, then pick a domain (a zone) to edit its DNS records, its settings, its cache and its security rules. It also links Cloudflare to your servers in Deploy: you can point a domain at a server in one step, give a server a DNS token for wildcard certificates, install a Cloudflare Origin CA certificate, and lock a server so only Cloudflare can reach it.

## Where to find it

Open **Deploy** in the sidebar under Ship, then click **Cloudflare: domains and DNS** under the server rail. If you have no saved servers yet, the Deploy page offers **Manage Cloudflare** instead. The address is `/deploy/cloudflare`. **Back to Deploy** at the top of the page returns you to your servers.

Cloudflare accounts are not tied to one server, so the page sits beside the server rail. The domain and tab you pick are remembered in the address, so going back and forth lands you in the same place.

## Connect Cloudflare with a token

The first time (or after you remove the token), the page shows a **Connect Cloudflare** card with two steps.

1. **Create a token on Cloudflare.** Click **Open Cloudflare's token page**. It opens with the permissions below already chosen and the name "AgentMate". Under Zone Resources, include all zones or just the domains AgentMate should manage, then create the token and copy it.
2. **Paste the token here.** Type or paste it into **API token** and click **Save and check**. AgentMate checks it with Cloudflare, seals it on this computer the way it seals your server passwords, and never shows it again.

AgentMate rejects things that are not an API token: your Global API Key (which can do anything on your account), an Origin CA Key, a token with spaces, or one that is too short or too long. Create a proper API token instead.

The permissions the token should have:

| Permission | What AgentMate uses it for |
| --- | --- |
| Zone > Zone > Read | See your domains |
| Zone > DNS > Edit | Add, change and remove DNS records |
| Zone > Zone Settings > Edit | Development mode, security level, SSL/TLS mode and Always Use HTTPS |
| Zone > Cache Purge > Purge | Purge cached files |
| Zone > Zone WAF > Edit | WAF custom rules |
| Zone > Firewall Services > Edit | IP access rules |

Two more permissions are asked for only when a feature needs them, so the main token can stay without them: **Zone > SSL and Certificates > Edit** (Origin CA certificates for your servers) and **User > API Tokens > Edit** (making a separate DNS token for a server).

### The token card

Once a token is saved, the **Cloudflare token** card shows when it was last checked, how many domains it can see, and a badge: **Active**, **Missing permissions**, **Expired** or **Disabled**. Every permission is listed as **Granted**, **Missing** or **Checked when first used**. Some tokens are checked by reading only, which changes nothing, so edit access is confirmed the first time you make a change.

When something is missing, a yellow box lists the exact permissions to add. Click **Edit the token on Cloudflare**, add them, then click **Check again**. If the token sees no domains, include them under Zone Resources on Cloudflare.

Other buttons on the card:

- **Check again** re-reads the token and refreshes the lists.
- **Replace token** shows the setup steps again (and **Keep the current token** backs out). A different token can see different zones.
- **Remove token** asks first. AgentMate forgets the token and stops managing your domains. The token keeps working on Cloudflare until you delete it there.

> [!NOTE]
> If your saved servers are locked with a passkey, the Cloudflare token is locked with them. A banner offers **Unlock**. Unlock first, then manage your domains.

## Domains (zones)

On the left, the **Domains** rail lists every zone the token can see with its state: **Active**, **Waiting for name servers**, **Setting up**, **Moved away** or **Paused**. Click one to manage it. If the list is empty, the token cannot see any domains yet: add a domain on Cloudflare, or include it under Zone Resources on the token.

At the top of a zone you see its name, its plan and a state badge. For a zone waiting for name servers, a notice shows the name servers your registrar must use. Until then, changes here do not reach visitors.

A zone has four tabs: **DNS**, **Settings**, **Security** and **Servers**.

## DNS tab

The **DNS records** card lists every record in the zone with its **Type**, **Name** (relative to the zone, `@` for the zone itself), **Content**, **Proxy** and **TTL**. Long content is shown in full in a tooltip.

- The **Proxy** switch turns Cloudflare's proxy on or off for A, AAAA and CNAME records, and says **Proxied** or **DNS only** next to it. Proxied means visitors reach Cloudflare first. DNS only means visitors reach the server directly.
- The pencil edits a record and the trash deletes it (after a confirmation that says what stops answering). Record types this page cannot edit are listed with "Edit on Cloudflare".

### Add or edit a record

1. Click **Add record**, or the pencil on a row.
2. Choose the **Type**: A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, CAA or SRV (fixed when editing).
3. Type the **Name**. It is saved relative to the zone, and the full name is shown under the field. Use `@` for the zone itself.
4. Fill in the fields for the type: an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, target, content, mail server with **Priority**, CAA **Flags**, **Tag** (issue, issuewild, iodef) and **Value**, or SRV **Priority**, **Weight**, **Port** and **Target**.
5. For A, AAAA and CNAME, choose whether to **Proxy through Cloudflare**. Proxied records always use the Auto TTL. Otherwise pick a **TTL** from Auto up to 1 day.
6. Optionally add a **Comment** (up to 500 characters, only you see it).
7. Click **Save record**. The change reaches Cloudflare as soon as you save.

### Point a domain to a server

**Point domain to a server** creates or updates the address records so a name reaches one of your saved servers (servers marked Development are not offered), and nothing else.

1. Click **Point domain to a server** on the DNS tab.
2. Choose the **Server** and the **Name** (`@` for the zone itself, or a name like `app`).
3. Turn **Also point www** on or off, and **Proxy through Cloudflare** on or off.
4. Click **Preview changes**. The list shows every record that would be added, changed or removed, with the server's addresses. Nothing happens that you have not seen. If the names already point at the server, it says there is nothing to change.
5. Click **Apply N changes**. Everything runs as one batch on Cloudflare, and running it again finds nothing to change.
6. A final screen offers **Add a website on <server>**. It opens that server's Websites section with a new site already filled in with those names. See [Websites and certificates](deploy-websites-certificates.md).

If you proxy the records and Cloudflare's SSL/TLS mode is weak (Off or Flexible, or Full without strict), the preview adds a warning that you can fix under **Settings**.

## Settings tab

The **Settings** card applies to everything in the zone, and changes apply within seconds.

- **Development mode** skips the cache for three hours so changes show at once. It shows the time left.
- **Security level** sets how suspicious a visitor has to look before Cloudflare checks them: Off, Essentially off, Low, Medium, High or I'm Under Attack. Under Attack shows every visitor a short check, with a reminder to turn it down afterwards.
- **SSL/TLS mode** sets how Cloudflare connects to your server for proxied records: Off (no HTTPS), Flexible, Full or Full (strict). Advice under it explains the risk of the current mode. **Use Full (strict)** switches in one click. Full (strict) needs a trusted certificate on the server, such as one from Let's Encrypt.
- **Always Use HTTPS** sends visitors who ask for `http://` to the `https://` address.

The **Cache** card below it purges Cloudflare's cached copies.

- **Purge these URLs**: paste one full URL per line (up to 30) and click the button.
- **Purge everything**: removes every cached file at once, so the next visits all reach your server. You must type the domain's name to confirm.

## Security tab

Two cards manage who can reach the zone.

### WAF custom rules

Lists the zone's custom rules in the order Cloudflare runs them, top to bottom (an allow rule skips the ones below it). Each row shows its description, its action (Block, Managed challenge, Interactive challenge, JavaScript challenge, Allow, Log) and its expression. A switch turns a rule on or off without losing it, and the trash deletes it after a confirmation.

Click **Add rule** to open the builder. Pick one of three kinds:

- **Block countries**: visitors from these countries get an error page. Enter two-letter codes separated by commas, such as `CN, RU` (T1 stands for Tor).
- **Challenge a path**: visitors to a page, such as a login, prove they are human first. Enter the **Path** (for example `/wp-login.php`) and choose **Match** as exactly this path or this path and everything under it.
- **Allow IP addresses**: requests from these addresses skip the other custom rules. Enter addresses and ranges, one per line or separated by commas. This rule goes first.

The dialog shows the **Description** (editable) and the exact expression and action Cloudflare will run, so nothing is added that you have not seen. Click **Add rule**.

### IP access rules

Block, challenge or allow an address, a range, a country or a network (ASN) for the whole zone. Type the value (for example `203.0.113.0/24`, `DE` or `AS13335`). The form says how it reads it (IP address, IPv6 address, IP range, Country or Network). Choose the **Action** (Block, Interactive challenge, JavaScript challenge, Managed challenge or Allow), add **Notes** if you like, and click **Add access rule**. Existing rules are listed with a trash button.

## Servers tab

The **Servers** tab holds the DNS tokens your servers keep for this zone.

### DNS tokens on your servers (DNS-01)

A server that holds a DNS token for the zone can get wildcard certificates and certificates for names behind the Cloudflare proxy, using Let's Encrypt's DNS-01 check. Each token edits this zone's DNS and nothing else. Only servers with the server core installed are listed. If none are, the card tells you to install the core in Deploy first.

For each server you see whether it **Holds a DNS token** (with when it was last used) or has none for the zone, plus any last error. The buttons are:

- **Make a DNS token** (or **Make a new token** to replace one). AgentMate asks Cloudflare, with your account token, to create a token limited to this zone's DNS and sends it to the server. This needs the **User > API Tokens > Edit** permission on your main token.
- **Paste a token** opens a field where you paste a token you made yourself on Cloudflare, with only Zone > DNS > Edit on this zone. Click **Check and send**. Use this if your main token cannot create tokens.
- **Remove** asks first. If AgentMate made the token, it is also deleted at Cloudflare. A token you pasted stays on Cloudflare, so delete it there if nothing else uses it. Wildcard certificates on that server stop renewing until it has a token again.

When Cloudflare refuses a step for want of a permission, a yellow box names the permission to add to the token and offers **Open Cloudflare's token page**.

Once a server has the token, the **Issue a certificate** dialog on a site's SSL tab can use **Validate over DNS (Cloudflare DNS-01)**. See [Websites and certificates](deploy-websites-certificates.md#certificates).

## Cloudflare on each server

Besides this page, Cloudflare shows up in a server's own sections:

- **Websites, SSL tab**: the **Cloudflare Origin CA** button has Cloudflare sign a certificate for a key the server makes. Only Cloudflare trusts it, so keep the site's records proxied and set SSL/TLS to Full (strict). It needs the SSL and Certificates permission. See [Websites and certificates](deploy-websites-certificates.md#cloudflare-origin-ca).
- **Websites, Domains tab**: arriving from **Point domain to a server** starts a new site with the pointed names.
- **Firewall section, Cloudflare-only origin card**: see below.

### Cloudflare-only origin

In **Deploy**, pick the server, click **Firewall**, and find the **Cloudflare-only origin** card. It stops visitors from going around Cloudflare to the server's own address. It shows one of four states:

- **Off: every address reaches ports 80 and 443**
- **Waiting for you to keep the firewall change**
- **On: only Cloudflare reaches ports 80 and 443**
- **On, but the firewall no longer matches** (the card lists rules not allowed yet, rules still open to everyone and rules that are no longer Cloudflare's)

It also shows how many IPv4 and IPv6 ranges the core has from Cloudflare and when it fetched them (the core refreshes the list daily), and whether Authenticated Origin Pulls are on.

Admins can click **Lock to Cloudflare** (or **Bring up to date** when it is already enabled), and **Turn off** to open the ports to everyone again.

1. Click **Lock to Cloudflare**. A dialog explains that ports 80 and 443 will only answer Cloudflare's published addresses and that nginx will log each visitor's own address.
2. Optionally tick **Also require Cloudflare's client certificate on HTTPS (Authenticated Origin Pulls)**. It is turned on for the zones of this server's sites first.
3. Check **Site domains on this server**. Any domain that is not proxied (DNS only, no record, or not in your Cloudflare account) is flagged, because it would stop answering once the lock is on. Turn the proxy on for those names first.
4. Read the exact firewall commands. If the safety guard blocks the change, it says why and the button stays disabled.
5. Click **Lock to Cloudflare** to apply. A firewall countdown starts, and you must keep the change from the banner over a new SSH connection or it is undone. See [Firewall and security](deploy-firewall-security.md).

If the firewall changed but nginx did not take its part, a warning points you to the Websites section.

## Tips

- Start with the token card. If anything seems off, **Check again** tells you which permission is missing.
- Preview before you apply when pointing a domain, and keep the proxy on if you plan to use the origin lock.
- Use **Development mode** while you are changing a site, then switch it off.
- Prefer **Full (strict)** with a real certificate on the server.
- Use the **Help** page (`F1`) and its **Ask the guide** chat for more. See [Help center](help-center.md).
