Deploy is where you manage your own Linux servers. You install a small program called the server core on a server (AgentMate reaches it through your SSH login, so no extra port is opened), and from then on you can watch the server live, update it, reboot it, run Docker containers, publish websites, set up a firewall and more.

This article explains the page itself: the server list, the sections of a server, and the Overview with its health score, charts, updates, services and reboot. Adding a server and installing the core is in [Deploy: servers and setup](deploy-servers-setup.md).

## Where to find it

Click **Deploy** in the sidebar under Ship, or open the command palette and type Deploy. The page header says "Install the server core on your servers and keep an eye on them."

## The server rail

On the left is the **Servers** list with a count. It shows every server you saved in [Remote](remote.md). Deploy does not have its own "add server" button. If a server is missing, click **Add or edit servers in Remote** under the list, add it there, and come back.

Each entry shows the server's nickname and a status line with a status mark:

| Status line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Core not installed | The server is saved but the server core is not on it yet. |
| Installing the core… / Removing the core… | A setup run is in progress (a spinner shows). |
| Connecting… | AgentMate is asking the core whether it answers. |
| Online, core 1.2.3 | The core answers. The version number is shown. |
| Not answering | The last check did not get an answer. |

Click a server to open it. AgentMate checks each core's health every 30 seconds while the page is open. Under the list there are two shortcuts: **Add or edit servers in Remote** and **Cloudflare: domains and DNS** (see [Cloudflare](cloudflare.md)).

If you have no saved servers at all, the page says **No servers yet** and offers **Open Remote** and **Manage Cloudflare**.

## The server header

Above the sections you see the server's nickname and its login as `user@host:port`. Two extra markers can appear:

- **Development** (a badge): this is the DevHost, a built-in test server that only exists in development builds of AgentMate. It has no SSH, so you cannot update or remove its core from the page.
- A connection badge on the right (once the core is installed). It says **Connected**, **Connecting**, **Reconnecting**, **Not connected**, **Sign-in needed**, **Access to set up again** or **Servers locked**. Hover it for the reason and what happens next. When the connection is live it also says how it travels (SSH, direct TLS or loopback). If a direct TLS certificate does not match the pinned one the badge says **Certificate mismatch**.

### Locked servers banner

If your saved servers are protected with a passkey and are still locked, a yellow banner says "Your saved servers are locked with a passkey. Unlock them to reach their cores." Click **Unlock** and confirm with your passkey. Until you do, Deploy cannot open SSH connections to your servers.

## Sections of a server

Once a server has its core installed, a tab strip appears under the header. The section you are on is part of the page address, so it survives a refresh. In a narrow window the strip scrolls sideways.

| Section | What it is for | Article |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Overview** | Health score, live charts, alerts, system facts, updates, services, reboot, core health and your access | This article |
| **Apps** | Your apps: Docker Compose stacks you deploy, update and watch, and private registry sign-ins | [Containers and stacks](deploy-containers-stacks.md) |
| **Containers** | Docker containers, images, volumes, networks and disk use | [Containers and stacks](deploy-containers-stacks.md) |
| **App Store** | One-click apps from a catalog | [App Store](deploy-app-store.md) |
| **Websites** | Nginx sites and certificates | [Websites and certificates](deploy-websites-certificates.md) |
| **Firewall** | Firewall rules with a safe apply | [Firewall and security](deploy-firewall-security.md) |
| **Logs** | Logs center and detected problems | [Assistant and logs](deploy-assistant-logs.md) |
| **Security** | Checklist, users, devices, audit, backups, connection | [Firewall and security](deploy-firewall-security.md) |

If the core is not installed (or you chose to update it), the install panel replaces the sections. See [Deploy: servers and setup](deploy-servers-setup.md).

### The Deploy AI button

On every section of an installed server there is a **Deploy AI** button in the bottom right corner. It opens an assistant drawer for that server. When a run is waiting for your approval or an answer, the button says **Waiting for you**. See [Deploy assistant and logs](deploy-assistant-logs.md).

## Overview

The Overview is the first section. It needs you to be signed in to the core. If you are not, it says "Sign in to see (server) live: its charts, services, alerts and updates." and shows only the **Server core** and **Your access** cards so you can sign in (see [Deploy: servers and setup](deploy-servers-setup.md#sign-in-to-the-core)). What you see and which buttons are enabled depend on your role on the core (Viewer, Operator, Admin or Owner). The core checks every action again, so a hidden button is not a loophole.

If the connection drops, everything stays on screen but dimmed, and it fills in again by itself when the connection returns.

### Running jobs

Long tasks on the server (package updates, restarts, reboots) are called jobs. While one runs, a bar near the top says "Running: (job title), started by (user)" with a **Show the log** button. The log dialog shows the output live (errors in a warning color), the state (Running, Done, Failed, Cancelled or Interrupted), and a **Cancel the job** button for Operators and above when the job can be cancelled. Closing the dialog leaves the job running. The whole log stays on the server.

### Pulse and health score

The **Pulse** card at the top has two parts.

The big number is the **Health score** out of 100, with a word next to it: **Healthy** (85 or more), **Needs a look** (60 to 84) or **In trouble** (below 60). Hover it to see what took points off. The score starts at 100 and loses points for:

- processor or memory above 75% (and more above 90%),
- a disk above 80% (and more above 90%),
- load above one (and above two) per core,
- swap more than half used,
- open alerts and failed services,
- security updates waiting,
- a reboot waiting,
- a clock that is out of sync.

The three ribbons show the last two minutes of **Processor**, **Memory** and **Network** (in and out), each with its current value. They dim when the live connection is down.

### Quick numbers

Below the pulse, four tiles show **Load, 1 / 5 / 15 min**, **Disk** (the fullest disk, with its mount point), **Swap in use** (or "No swap") and **Updates waiting** (with how many are security updates).

### Alerts

The **Alerts** card lists open alerts from the core, for example disk pressure, a failed job or a reboot waiting. Each shows a severity (**Critical**, **Warning** or **Info**), how many times it fired and how long ago, and who acknowledged it. Operators and above get an **Acknowledge** button. With nothing open it says "No open alerts."

### History charts

The **History** card draws four charts: **Processor**, **Memory**, **Network** (received and sent) and **Disk activity** (read and written). Pick a range with the switch at the top:

| Range | What you see |
| --- | --- |
| **Live** | The last 15 minutes, a point every 2 seconds |
| **6 hours** | One point a minute |
| **2 days** | One point a minute |
| **30 days** | One point every 15 minutes |

The longer ranges come from readings the core stores, starting from when it was installed, so a new core has no 30 day history yet. The **Table** button switches the charts to a table of readings (the newest 60), and **Charts** switches back. Hover a chart to read the values at a point in time.

### System

The **System** card shows what the server is: host name and OS, processor model and cores, memory and swap, every disk with a usage bar (the bar turns yellow above 80% and red above 90%), network interfaces, public address, kernel, how long it has been up, and whether the clock is in sync (with time zone and sync service). If a reboot is waiting (for example after a kernel update) a yellow note says so and names what asked for it.

### Reboot

Operators and above see a **Reboot** button on the System card. It asks you to type the server's nickname to confirm, and warns that websites and apps are down until the server is back, usually within a couple of minutes. Rebooting also asks you to confirm your password (see below). After you confirm, a banner says the server is about to reboot, then that AgentMate is waiting for it to come back. The page reconnects by itself, and a message says "(server) is back." when it does.

### Updates

The **Updates** card shows packages that can be updated, with security updates marked, and when the server last checked.

- **Check for updates** asks the package manager for new versions now (Operators and above).
- **Install security updates** (only shown when there are some) and **Install all** (Operators and above) first open a preview listing exactly which packages change and warn that services using them may restart. Confirm with **Install (n) updates**. A job log opens so you can follow it.
- **Install all** takes your password again (see below). Installing only the security updates does not.
- **Automatic security updates** is a switch, shown when the server supports it. It says whether the feature is on and which mechanism does it. Only Admins and Owners can change it.
- While one package job runs, the buttons wait.

### Services

The **Services** card lists the services systemd reports for the server, each with a state (**Running**, **Reloading**, **Stopped**, **Failed**, **Starting**, **Stopping**, **Unknown**). Services that are not installed are hidden. For Docker and nginx, Operators and above also get a **Restart** button.

### Server core and Your access

At the bottom of the Overview are two cards about the core itself. **Server core** shows the status (**Online**, **Not answering** or **Connecting…**), version, how long the core has been up, when it was installed, the operating system, processor and how the connection travels, plus **Check now**, and a menu with **Update or reinstall** and removal actions. **Your access** shows how this computer signs in. Both are explained in [Deploy: servers and setup](deploy-servers-setup.md).

### Confirm it is you

Some changes (installing every update, rebooting, and sensitive security changes) ask for your password again in a dialog called **Confirm it is you**. If your account uses two-factor you can switch to **Use a code from your authenticator app**. The confirmation counts for the next 10 minutes, so you are not asked again for each step.

## Tips

- The color of a status is always backed by a word or icon, so read the text if colors are hard to tell apart.
- If a server shows **Not answering** right after a restart, wait a minute. The core starts with the server and answers again shortly.
- If you only have a Viewer role you can look at everything but change nothing. Ask an Owner on that server to raise your role.
