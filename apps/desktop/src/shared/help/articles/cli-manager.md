AI CLI Manager is the page that knows which AI coding agents are installed on your machine. It scans for them, shows their versions, installs the ones you are missing, and tells you when a newer version is out. The agents you manage here are the ones you launch in the Workspace, so this is also where the related settings (default CLI, launch defaults, agent order) are explained.

## Where to find it

Click **AI CLI Manager** in the sidebar under **Agents**, or open the command palette and type "AI CLI Manager". The related settings live in **Settings** under the **Agents** group (see [Settings](settings.md)).

## Supported CLIs

AgentMate knows these 15 CLIs. Each one has a card on the page.

| CLI | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code CLI | Anthropic's agentic coding CLI. |
| Codex CLI | OpenAI's local coding agent. |
| Gemini CLI | Google's command-line agent. |
| Cursor CLI | Cursor's agent for the terminal. Installed with Cursor's own install script. |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | GitHub's Copilot agent in the terminal. |
| OpenCode | Open-source terminal coding agent. |
| OpenClaude | Open-source agent that runs against any model provider. |
| Grok CLI | xAI's Grok coding agent. |
| Qwen CLI | Alibaba's Qwen Code agent. |
| FreeBuff CLI | Free, ad-supported coding agent. |
| Aider | AI pair programming in your local git repo. Installed with `pipx`. |
| Goose | Block's on-machine agent. |
| Cline CLI | Autonomous coding agent from the Cline team. |
| Continue CLI | Open-source assistant CLI (`cn`). |
| Pi | Minimal, extensible terminal coding agent. |

Most of them install with `npm install -g ...`, so you need Node.js and npm on your machine for those. Aider uses `pipx`, Cursor CLI and Goose use their own install scripts.

## How detection works

When you open the page, AgentMate looks for each CLI on your `PATH` and runs its version command. A CLI counts as installed as soon as its executable is found, even if the version check is slow (some CLIs take more than ten seconds to answer, and one that is updating itself may not answer at all). In that case the badge just says **Installed** instead of a version number.

Results are cached for a few minutes, so moving between pages does not rescan every time. If something is missing, the scan result is only kept for about 20 seconds, so a CLI you just installed shows up quickly.

## The page

### Installed and not installed CLIs

By default the page shows only the CLIs it found. Each card has the CLI's logo and name, a version badge (green with the version number when installed, **Not installed** otherwise) and a short description.

- If nothing is installed yet, the page says "No AI CLIs installed yet" and points you to **Show all CLIs**.
- Click **Show all CLIs (N not installed)** at the top to list every supported CLI, including the missing ones. The button then reads **Hide not installed**.

### Open a CLI in a terminal

On an installed card, click the CLI's name or logo. AgentMate opens a terminal session and starts that CLI, with your launch defaults (see below) already added to the command.

### Install a CLI

1. Click **Show all CLIs** if the CLI you want is hidden.
2. Click **Install** on its card.
3. A terminal opens with the install command already typed in. Press `Enter` in that terminal to run it.
4. When it finishes, click **Refresh** at the top of the page. The card switches to installed.

If a CLI has no install command for your operating system, you get a message saying so instead of a terminal.

### Check for updates

- Click the cloud icon (**Check for updates**) on an installed card to check that one CLI. AgentMate asks the package registry (npm, PyPI or GitHub Releases) for the latest version.
- Click **Check all for updates** at the top to check every installed CLI, one after another.

If an update exists, an **Update <name>?** dialog shows the current version, the latest version and the exact command. Click **Update** to open a terminal with the command typed in (press `Enter` to run it), or **Cancel** to skip. When several CLIs have updates, the dialog steps through them one by one.

Possible messages:

- "<name> is up to date" means you are on the latest version.
- "Can't check updates for <name> automatically" means that CLI has no update source AgentMate can query.
- "Couldn't reach the update server" means the registry did not answer (check your connection).

### Refresh

**Refresh** skips the cache and scans again from scratch. Use it after you install, uninstall or update a CLI in a terminal of your own.

### Set a default CLI

On an installed card, click **Set as default**. The button turns into **Default CLI**, and clicking it again clears the default. Only one CLI can be the default.

The default CLI is what AgentMate uses when a feature needs an AI agent and does not ask you which one. You can also pick it in **Settings** under **Agents** in the **Default CLI** card, which has a searchable list and a clear button.

### Background task arguments

Each installed card has a **Background task arguments** box. Anything you type here (for example `--model sonnet`) is added when AgentMate runs that CLI in the background on its own: commit messages, tag suggestions, version bumps and skill audits. The box shows the full command underneath so you can see what will run.

These arguments are never used for terminals or Workspace tabs. Those use **Launch defaults** instead. The value saves when you leave the box or press `Enter`. The same box also appears in **Settings** under the **Default CLI** card for the CLI you picked as the default.

### Open the homepage

The arrow icon (**Open homepage**) on a card opens the CLI's website in your browser.

## Launch defaults

**Launch defaults** is a card in **Settings** under **Agents**. It sets the model, effort and mode each agent starts with when AgentMate opens it in a terminal or a Workspace tab.

1. Open **Settings**, go to **Agents** and find **Launch defaults**.
2. Click an agent's row to expand it. Only agents that AgentMate knows launch flags for are listed, and installed ones come first. Click **Show N not installed** at the bottom to list the rest.
3. Pick a **Model**. You can search the list or type any model name.
4. Pick an **Effort** (a segmented control: **Not set**, Low, Med, High, XHigh, Max). Levels the chosen model cannot use are disabled, and the control dims when the model has no effort setting.
5. For agents with permission modes, choose a **Mode** card. Modes depend on the CLI, for example **Ask first**, **Accept edits**, **Plan** and **Auto** for Claude Code. Modes that let the agent change files and run commands without asking, such as **Bypass permissions**, carry a warning triangle.
6. The preview line shows exactly what the terminal will type, for example `claude --permission-mode auto --model sonnet`.

Anything left on **Not set** adds no flag, so the CLI picks its own value. Click **Reset** to clear a row. Each collapsed row shows the values you set as small chips.

Launch defaults apply only to terminals and Workspace tabs. To start an agent without them once, hold `Alt` and click the launcher.

> [!NOTE]
> A risky mode is applied to every tab you open with that agent. Use it only for projects you can restore from git.

## Agent order

**Agent order** (in **Settings** under **Agents**) controls the order agents are listed in when you start one in the Workspace: the **+** menu, the tiles in an empty pane and the number keys that pick them.

- Drag a row to move it, or use the up and down arrows on the right of each row.
- Installed agents get the number keys 1 to 9 in this order. Agents that are not installed show **Not installed** and get no number.
- Click **Default order** to go back to the standard order.

## Running CLIs

The **Running CLIs** window shows every terminal that is open across your Workspace tabs and the terminal drawer, with the CPU and memory each one is using. Open it from any of these:

- The terminal count in the status bar at the bottom of the window (for example "3 terminals").
- The **Running CLIs** button (chip icon) in the Workspace header.
- The command palette, by typing "Running CLIs".

The window refreshes every few seconds while it is open.

- The top strip shows total **CPU**, **RAM** and how many terminals are running. Each terminal counts its shell and every process it started, agent CLIs included.
- Each row shows the terminal name, its project, where it lives (**Workspace**, **Terminal drawer**, **SSH** or **Detached**), the agent's state (such as needs input), how long it has been running, and its CPU, memory and process count. SSH sessions show **Remote, no stats** because they run on the remote server. A busy terminal's CPU is highlighted.
- Click the arrow on a row (**Show details**) to see the shell, folder, process ID and a table of its processes.
- The row buttons are **Open** (jumps to that terminal), **Restart** (Workspace tabs only, restarts it with the same command) and **End session** (or **Close tab** when its shell has already ended). Ending a session ends everything in it, including the agent, so unsaved agent work is lost. AgentMate asks you to confirm.
- Use the checkboxes and **End selected** to end several at once. **Select all** works on the rows currently shown.
- Type in the search box to match name, project, CLI, folder or process. **Filters** lets you filter by **Where**, **Kind** (**Agent CLIs** or **Plain shells**) and **State** (**Running** or **Shell ended**). **Show everything** clears the filters.
- **Sort by** offers CPU, Memory, Age, Name and Project. Choosing the same one again flips the direction.
- **Refresh now** (the circular arrow in the header) re-reads usage immediately.

## CLI and tool update notifications

In **Settings** under **General**, the **Check for CLI and tool updates** switch makes AgentMate check once a day. It looks at every installed CLI here and every installed tool on the [Agent Tools](agent-tools.md) page. When a newer version exists, it adds a notification ("<name> update available", with the old and new version) and rings the notification bell. Each release is announced only once. The check runs in the background, and a laptop that was asleep catches up soon after it wakes.

## Tips

- If a CLI you just installed is not detected, click **Refresh**. If it is still missing, open a new terminal and make sure the command works there, since AgentMate looks on your `PATH`.
- Windows users installing npm CLIs need Node.js installed first.
- Use **Launch defaults** for how an agent starts in the Workspace, and **Background task arguments** for what AgentMate runs silently. They are separate on purpose.
