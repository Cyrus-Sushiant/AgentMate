AgentMate has a list of shortcuts you can change (the app, Workspace, prompt builder, changes panel and Vault) and a smaller set of fixed keys that work the way they do in other tools, such as `Ctrl+S` to save. This article lists both. On macOS, `Ctrl` in the tables below is `Cmd`, `Alt` is `Option` and `Shift` is `Shift`. AgentMate treats `Ctrl` and `Cmd` as the same key, so one binding works on every system.

## Where to find it

Click **Settings** in the main menu, open the **Shortcuts** tab and use the **Keyboard shortcuts** card. The page is at `/settings?tab=shortcuts`. The Help page, with its own search and **Ask the guide** chat, opens with `F1`. You can rebind it like any other shortcut (it is **Open Help** in the **Navigation** group).

## Rebinding shortcuts

### Rebind a shortcut

1. Open **Settings**, **Shortcuts**.
2. Find the command. They are grouped as **Terminal**, **Navigation**, **Prompt builder**, **Workspace**, **Changes panel** and **Vault**, and each group says where it applies.
3. Click the **+** (Add a shortcut) next to the command. The row shows "Press keys... (Esc to cancel)".
4. Press the new key combination. It is saved immediately, there is no Save button.

A command can have more than one shortcut. For example **Toggle terminal** starts with both `Ctrl+T` and `Ctrl` plus the backtick key (the key above `Tab` on most keyboards). Click the **x** on a shortcut chip to remove just that one. A command with nothing bound shows "Not set".

### Reset shortcuts

The circular arrow at the end of a command's row (tooltip "Restore the default") puts that one command back to its default. It is greyed out when the command is already on its default. **Restore defaults** at the top of the card resets every command at once.

Only the commands you changed are remembered. Commands you never touched follow the defaults, so they pick up any new default in a later version.

### Binding rules

- **Physical keys.** A shortcut is matched by the physical key, not the character it types, so shortcuts keep working after you switch to a Persian, Russian, Greek or any other keyboard layout.
- **Needs a modifier.** A shortcut must hold `Ctrl`, `Cmd` or `Alt`, or be a function key (`F1` to `F12`). Anything else would swallow normal typing, and the card says "Hold Ctrl, Cmd, or Alt, or use a function key."
- **No clashes within a scope.** If another command in the same scope already uses the combination, the card refuses it and tells you which one ("`Ctrl+K` is already used by ..."). Different scopes can share a key, which is how `Ctrl+T` translates in the prompt builder and toggles the terminal everywhere else.
- **Scopes.** App-wide shortcuts work anywhere. **Workspace** shortcuts only work on the Workspace page and beat the app-wide ones there. **Prompt builder** shortcuts only work while the prompt builder is open. **Changes panel** shortcuts only work while you type a commit message. **Vault** shortcuts only work on the Vault page while it is unlocked.
- **Dialogs win.** A dialog that binds the same combination takes it while it is open.
- **Number rows.** **Open agent 1 to 9** and **Go to tab 1 to 9** are stored as one binding for the whole row of number keys. Press any number key with the modifiers you want, and the card shows it as "`Ctrl+1...9`". Holding the same modifiers with 1 to 9 picks the item.
- **Inside a terminal.** While a terminal has focus, the app-wide and Workspace shortcuts go to AgentMate instead of the shell, with one exception: the diff keys (`F7`, `Shift+F7`) go to the program in the terminal.

## App-wide

These work on every page. Their groups in Settings are **Terminal** and **Navigation**.

| Command | Default | What it does |

## Prompt builder

These work only while the prompt builder is open (the Prompt Builder page, the Build Prompt dialog and the Build Prompt desktop widget).

| Generate prompt | `Ctrl+G`, `Ctrl+Enter` | Builds the prompt from your request. |
| Translate request | `Ctrl+T` | Rewrites your request in English without generating. |
| Copy generated prompt | `Ctrl+C` | Copies the result. Ignored while text is selected, so normal copy still works. |

| New worktree | `Ctrl+Shift+N` | Starts a git worktree of the project on screen. |
| Run project | `F5` | Does what the header's Run button does: starts the project's run command, or asks which one when there are several. |
| Search files and code | `Ctrl+P` | Finds files, types, members and text in the project, with a preview. On the Workspace it takes `Ctrl+P` from Go to Projects. |

## Changes panel

These work while the cursor is in the commit message box of the Workspace changes panel.

| Command | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commit | `Ctrl+Enter` | Commits the staged changes, or stages everything first when nothing is staged. |
| Commit and push | `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` | Commits, then pushes the branch. |

## Vault

These work on the Vault page while the Vault is unlocked, and step aside for open dialogs and for the terminal drawer.

## Fixed keys you cannot rebind

These keys are built in. They do not appear in the Settings list.

### Going back and forward

| Keys | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `Alt+Left`, `Alt+Right` | Go back and forward through the pages you visited. On macOS `Cmd+[` and `Cmd+]` do the same. |
| Mouse back and forward buttons | The thumb buttons on the side of a mouse do the same. |

### Terminal text

| Keys | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+C` | Copies the selection when the terminal has one. With nothing selected it is a normal `Ctrl+C` and interrupts the running program. |
| `Ctrl+V`, `Shift+Insert` | Pastes the clipboard. Text and screenshots both work. |
| `Shift+Enter` | Inserts a new line in an agent CLI's prompt instead of submitting it. |
| `Ctrl`+click on a link | Opens the link. A plain click just selects text. |
| Right-click | Copies the selection if there is one, otherwise pastes. A program that asked for mouse events gets the right-click instead, and `Shift`+right-click still pastes. |
| `Esc` | Brings a maximized terminal drawer back to its normal size. |

### Workspace browser tabs

When the cursor is inside a web page in a Workspace browser tab, these keys work:

| Keys | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+L` | Moves focus to the address bar. |
| `F5`, `Ctrl+R` | Reload the page. |
| `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Reload without the cache. |
| `Alt+Left`, `Alt+Right` | Back and forward (`Cmd+[` and `Cmd+]` on macOS). |
| `F12`, `Ctrl+Shift+I` | Open developer tools (`Cmd+Option+I` on macOS). |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Pick an element on the page. |

### Editors

| Keys | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+S` | Saves the file in a Workspace file tab and in the project file browser. |
| `Ctrl+S`, `Ctrl+B`, `Ctrl+I`, `Ctrl+K` | In the Markdown editor (Blueprint steps and similar): save, bold, italic and insert a link. |
| `Tab`, `Shift+Tab` | In the Markdown editor, indent and outdent. `Enter` continues a list. |

The code editor is Monaco, the editor behind VS Code, so its usual keys such as `Ctrl+F` for find also work inside a file.

### Workspace search

Open it with the **Search files and code** shortcut (`Ctrl+P` on the Workspace by default).

| Keys | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `Up`, `Down`, `PageUp`, `PageDown` | Move through results. |
| `Enter` | Opens the result. |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Opens it in a pane to the side. |
| `Shift+Enter` | Opens it as a preview tab. |
| `Tab`, `Shift+Tab` | Switch the search filter (All, Files, Types, Members, Text). |
| `Alt+C`, `Alt+W`, `Alt+R` | Toggle Match case, Match whole word and Use regular expression. |
| Prefix `f:`, `t:`, `m:`, `x:` | Type one before your query to search Files, Types, Members or Text only. |

### API Client

| Keys | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Sends the current request. |
| `Ctrl+S` | Saves the request. |
| `Ctrl+N` | Opens a new request tab. |

### Vault list

When the Vault list has focus: `Up` and `Down` move the selection, `Home` and `End` jump to the first and last entry, `Enter` opens the selected entry and `Delete` removes it. In the search box, `Up`, `Down` and `Enter` do the same and `Esc` clears the search.

### Settings page

| Keys | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+F` | Puts the cursor in the Settings search box. |
| `Ctrl+S` | Saves all unsaved changes on the page. |

### Forms and chats

| Keys | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Saves in the project form and the SSH and Remote Desktop server forms. In the prompt composer dialog (scheduled prompts) it schedules or saves the prompt. In pull request comments and review replies it posts them. |
| `Enter` | Sends a message in Ask AI. `Shift+Enter` adds a new line. |
| `Up`, `Down`, `Enter`, `Esc` | Move through, pick from and close the command palette. |

### Remote Desktop

`Ctrl+Alt+Break` switches a Remote Desktop session window between full screen and a normal window.

## Tips

- If a shortcut does nothing, check whether you are on the right page: Workspace, Vault and prompt builder shortcuts only work there.
- The command palette (`Ctrl+K`) finds any page or action when you cannot remember its key.
- Hover over a button. Many tooltips show the shortcut next to the name, and they update when you rebind it.
