A skill is a folder of instructions (usually a `SKILL.md` file) that an AI agent reads and follows, such as a code review checklist or a commit message guide. The Skills page is a marketplace for them. You can browse the skills.sh directory, add your own skill repositories, install skills into projects or globally, keep a list of favorites, see which skills your agents really use, and scan any skill for unsafe instructions before you trust it.

## Where to find it

Click **Skills** in the sidebar under **Agents**, or open the command palette and type "Skills". The page title reads **Skill Marketplace**. The command palette also searches the skills in your repositories: pick one and AgentMate opens the Skills page with that repository and skill name carried into the **Repositories** tab's filter.

Installed skills also show up in a project's **Skills** tab (see [Projects](projects.md)), and **Settings** under **General** has a **Skill repositories** card with a **Manage** button that jumps here.

## The tabs

The page has six tabs along the top, plus a **Global Skills** button on the right.

| Tab | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| **Directory** | Browse popular skills from skills.sh. |
| **Featured** | Skills that ship their own installer, such as UI UX Pro Max. |
| **Repositories** | Skills from repositories you added (a folder, a git repo or a JSON index). |
| **Favorites** | Every skill you starred, in one place. |
| **Usage** | Which skills your agents invoked, and how often. |
| **Security** | Check any skill for unsafe instructions and see your check history. |

## Directory (skills.sh)

The **Directory** tab lists popular skills from [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh). A snapshot of the catalog is bundled with the app, so you can browse it offline. The text above the grid tells you how many skills are bundled and the snapshot date.

- Use the **Search** box to filter by name, owner or description.
- **Bundled** searches the offline snapshot. **Live** searches the full skills.sh catalog over the internet. Live search needs at least 2 characters and shows "Couldn't reach skills.sh" if you are offline.
- **Official only** hides everything except publishers skills.sh has verified. Official skills carry an **Official** badge and a blue check mark. Everything else is badged **Community**.
- The grid loads 36 skills at a time. Click **Show more** to load the next batch.

Each card shows the skill name, a short description, **Official** or **Community**, how many installs it has, its repository and the result of its last security check if you ran one. The card buttons are:

- The star, to favorite the skill.
- **Install**, which opens the install picker (see below).
- **View**, which opens a dialog with the full description and the exact install command. The dialog has a copy button, **Install…** and **Open on skills.sh**.
- The shield, to check the skill for unsafe instructions.
- The arrow icon, to open the skill's page on skills.sh.

## Repositories

The **Repositories** tab is for skills you collect yourself. A repository is a source of skills that AgentMate indexes for you.

If you have no repositories yet, AgentMate adds one called **AgentMate Examples** that lives on your machine and holds three sample skills (Code Review Checklist, Commit Message Guide and Caveman).

### Add a repository

1. Open the **Repositories** tab and click **Add Repository**.
2. Enter a **Name**. For a local folder you can leave it empty to use the folder name.
3. Choose the **Type**:
   - **Local folder**: a folder on your computer. Type or paste the path, or click the folder icon to browse. The dialog checks the folder and tells you how many skills it found. A folder of skills can be subfolders that each hold a `SKILL.md`, or plain `.md` files. A `repository.json` file is optional.
   - **Git repository**: a URL such as `https://github.com/org/skills.git`. AgentMate clones it and pulls updates when you refresh.
   - **URL (JSON index)**: a link to a `repository.json` index file.
4. Click **Add**. For git and URL sources a name is required.

Local folders are watched, so adding or deleting a skill in the folder updates the marketplace by itself.

### Browse a repository

- The **Repository** picker defaults to **All repositories**, which puts every repository's skills in one grid. Pick a single repository to narrow it down. In the all view, a repository name on a card is a link that switches to that repository.
- The refresh button re-reads the selected repository (or all of them). The trash button removes the selected repository from AgentMate (skills already installed stay where they are).
- **Search** filters by name, description, category, tag or repository name.
- Each card shows the name, category, tags, author and version, and the last security check result. Buttons: the star, **Install**, the shield (security check) and **Docs** when the skill has a documentation link.
- If a repository cannot be read, its name and the error appear in red above the grid.
- The grid shows 36 at a time, with a **Show more** button.

## Install a skill

Clicking **Install** on any card opens an **Install <skill>** dialog.

1. Optionally type in **Search projects** to narrow the list.
2. Tick **Install globally** to make the skill available to every project, and/or tick one or more projects.
3. Click **Install**. The button shows how many places you picked.

What happens next depends on where the skill came from:

- **From a repository** (including the example repository): AgentMate copies the skill files straight into each project's agent skills folder. It uses the folders the project already has (for example `.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills`, `.codex/skills` or `.cursor/skills`), or falls back to the default for the project's agent type. A global install goes into `~/.claude/skills`. You get an "Installed to N locations" message.
- **From skills.sh**: AgentMate opens a terminal for each place you picked and types the exact install command skills.sh publishes. Press `Enter` in each terminal to run it. A global install runs the same command from your home folder.

> [!NOTE]
> Skills.sh installs need Node.js, since the command runs through `npx`.

## Global Skills

Click **Global Skills** (top right of the page, with a count) to see every skill installed for all projects.

- Filter by assistant with the buttons **All**, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode and Gemini.
- Each row shows the skill, its version, the assistants it is installed for, an **update available** badge when a newer version exists, and its last security verdict.
- Row buttons: the star, the shield (security check), **Update** (when a newer version is available) and the trash can to remove it. Removing asks you to confirm. For UI UX Pro Max, removing opens a terminal with the uninstall command for you to run.

Updates to a project's skills are shown in that project's **Skills** tab, with the same **Update** button.

## Featured: UI UX Pro Max

The **Featured** tab holds skills that come with their own installer, so AgentMate walks you through the installer instead of copying a folder. Right now that is **UI UX Pro Max**, a design skill that turns a product description into a design system and keeps the assistant on it while it writes UI code.

The card has these buttons:

- **Install** (or **Install again** when it is already installed globally) opens the install wizard.
- **What it does** opens an explainer: how a request flows, the sector rules, supported stacks and example prompts.
- **Check for updates** compares your installed version with the latest release. If there is an update, **Update now** opens a terminal with the update commands typed in (press `Enter` to run them). When it was installed through the Claude Code plugin marketplace, you update it from `/plugin` inside Claude Code instead.
- Icon buttons open its GitHub repository and website.

### The install wizard

1. **Method**: choose **npm CLI** (recommended, installs the `uipro` CLI once and runs `uipro init` where you want the skill), **npx, nothing installed globally**, or **Claude Code plugin marketplace** (two slash commands typed inside Claude Code, Claude Code only).
2. **Assistants**: pick which AI assistants get the skill, or **Every assistant**. (Skipped for the plugin method.)
3. **Location**: tick the projects, and/or install globally. (Skipped for the plugin method.)
4. **Review**: the wizard checks prerequisites (npm, Python 3 and whether the `uipro` CLI is already installed), then shows the exact commands. Click **Open N terminals** to type them into terminals, then press `Enter` in each one, starting with the CLI install. For the plugin method, **Copy both commands** and paste them into a Claude Code session.

Python 3 is needed for the skill's scripts. The wizard offers **Get Python** when it is missing.

## Favorites

Click the star on a skill to favorite it. A star works on cards in the Directory, Repositories and Usage tabs and on rows in Global Skills. The **Favorites** tab (with a count) lists them all. It has a **Search favorites** box and the same actions as the original card: **Install**, copy the install command, the shield and an open-on-skills.sh link. Cards show a badge for where the skill came from (**skills.sh**, **Repository**, **Installed** or **Local**), how often your agents used it, and its last security verdict. Click the star again to remove it. With no favorites, the tab explains how to add some.

## Usage

The **Usage** tab shows which skills your agents actually invoked. It reads the Claude Code session transcripts on your machine, so it counts every run, whether you started the session from AgentMate or from another terminal. Nothing leaves your computer. The first scan reads every session and can take a moment. Click **Rescan** to read new activity, and the header shows how many sessions were read and when.

- Four tiles show **Skills used**, **Total invocations**, **Last 7 days** and **Last used**.
- A **Last 30 days** bar chart shows invocations per day. Hover a bar for the exact count.
- **By skill** lists each skill with a bar, a small 30-day trend, the projects it was used in, its count and when it was last used. Sort with **Most used**, **Recently used** or **Name**. The top three get a medal color.
- **By project** groups the same data by project folder.
- **Search used skills or projects** filters either view.
- The folder-plus icon (**Add to another project**) opens a dialog that finds where the skill's files live (a project, your global skills or a plugin) and copies the folder into the projects you tick. Projects that already have it show **Already has it** and are left alone.
- The star favorites a skill.

If there are no transcripts yet, or none that used a skill, the tab says so.

## Security checks

A skill is text an agent will follow, so a bad one can do real harm. AgentMate can scan a skill's files for risky instructions without installing or running anything.

### What it looks for

The scan matches the skill's text against 14 risk categories: Prompt injection, Data exfiltration, Credential theft, Privilege escalation, Supply chain, Remote code execution, Anti-refusal, System prompt leakage, Memory poisoning, Unsafe output handling, Dark-pattern payment funnel, Hidden content, Destructive actions and Overbroad permissions. The **Security** tab lists each with a one-line description.

### Run a check

1. Click the shield on a skill card (or in Global Skills, Favorites, or a project's Skills tab).
2. In the **Security check** dialog, optionally turn on **Deep review with an agent CLI** (see below).
3. Click **Run security check**. While it runs you can click **Cancel**.

The report shows a verdict, a score out of 100, the number of files scanned, finding counts by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and each finding with its line and the offending text. Verdicts are **Looks safe**, **Read before installing**, **Risky** and **Do not install**. A clean result is not a guarantee. It only means nothing matched a known pattern, so read a skill before trusting it with anything sensitive.

The dialog also lists **Earlier checks** for that skill. Click one to reopen it, or click **Check again** to rescan. The last verdict also appears as a badge on the skill's cards.

### Deep review with an agent CLI

Turn on **Deep review with an agent CLI** to send the skill's text to an installed CLI for a second opinion. It is slower and can only make the verdict stricter. Choose a CLI from the list (**Default CLI (from Settings)** or any installed CLI that can answer a one-off prompt). Findings from the review are tagged **CLI review**, and the CLI's own summary is shown in the report. If no suitable CLI is detected, install one from [AI CLI Manager](cli-manager.md).

### Check any skill

At the top of the **Security** tab, **Check any skill** scans something that is not installed or added as a repository:

1. Type or paste a folder path or a GitHub address, or click the folder icon to browse. A GitHub link can point at the repository, a branch or the skill's own folder. Short forms like `owner/repo`, a skills.sh address, or a whole `npx skills add ...` command work too.
2. AgentMate lists the skills it finds there (**N skills found**).
3. Click **Check** on one, or **Check all (N)** to scan them one after another with progress ("Checking 3 of 12"). **Open** appears instead of **Check** when a skill already has a result.

The deep-review switch applies to the whole **Check all** run, and it runs the CLI once per skill, so it can take a long time.

A project's **Skills** tab has the same **Check all** and deep review options for the skills installed there, and an "Also in this project" list for skills that came with the repository rather than from AgentMate.

### Check history

Every check is saved on this machine. The **Security** tab shows **Check history** with the saved count. Each entry shows the skill, verdict, where it came from (Repository, Installed, GitHub or Local folder), a CLI badge if a deep review ran, the finding count and the time. Use **View** to reopen the full report and the trash icon to delete one. **Clear history** deletes them all after you confirm (the skills themselves are not touched).

## Tips

- Run a security check on any community skill before you install it, especially one with few installs.
- Use **Install globally** for skills you want everywhere, and a project install for skills that only make sense in one codebase.
- Keep favorites for the skills you reinstall often.
- Use [AI CLI Manager](cli-manager.md) to install the CLI you want for deep reviews.
