 * The App Store of a Deploy server (E12) and "make private" (E13). The catalog itself is code in
 * @agentmat/core, so the renderer reads it directly; what crosses to the main process is what was
 * picked. The main process renders the compose file and the .env again from these choices and
 * never takes a file from the renderer. Generated secrets travel inwards once, with the install;
 * after that they are on the server only, and come back through a step-up reveal.
