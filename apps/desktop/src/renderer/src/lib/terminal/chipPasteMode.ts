/**
 * Takes over the terminal's current input line so a pasted file can show as a short chip
 * instead of its whole path, while the shell still gets the real path once the line runs.
 *
 * It only ever engages on a line where a paste actually happened, and only once the shell has
 * reported (via an OSC 7750 marker injected at spawn, see `main/ptyHost/shellIntegration.ts`)
 * that it is sitting at a fresh prompt. Until then every keystroke is forwarded untouched, as
 * one write per chunk: splitting a chunk would tear escape sequences apart, and an arrow key
 * arriving as three separate writes reads to the shell as the literal text `[D`.
 *
 * It only ever owns what it draws itself, starting at the cursor. Whatever was typed before the
 * paste stays with the shell, which still holds it in its own line buffer, so it is never copied
 * into the model and never sent twice. Editing back past that point hands the line over.
 *
 * Anything it can't safely interpret (Tab, history, Ctrl+R, a resize, a line that would wrap)
 * resolves every chip to real text, hands the resolved line to the shell so its own echo
 * repaints it, and reverts to plain passthrough until the next fresh-prompt marker.
