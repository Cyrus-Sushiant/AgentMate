/**
 * The whole suite leans on one thing: an AgentMate started with its own profile never touches
 * another one. Two guarantees back that up, and both are checked here.
 *
 * A second app on the SAME profile must lose the single-instance lock and quit, leaving the first
 * one running (that is what keeps a test from stealing the window of a real install, or of the
 * app the developer has open). Two apps on DIFFERENT profiles must both run, which is what lets
 * a test launch a second instance at all (backup.e2e.ts does).
 *
 * The same-profile case cannot use `launchApp`: Playwright's Electron launcher waits for a window
 * that this process is never going to open, so it is started directly instead, the same way
 * `app.ts` does.
