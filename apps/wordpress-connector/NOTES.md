# AgentMate Connector: working notes

Short notes for whoever works on the plugin next. The contract lives in
`packages/core/src/deploy/wordpress/` (TS is the source of truth); `tests/Unit/VectorsTest.php`
runs every shared vector.

## Running things

- `node scripts/wordpress-connector.mjs test [--php 7.4,8.3]` (Composer in `composer:2`, PHPUnit in
  `php:X-cli`), `lint` (php -l on 7.4/8.0/8.3/8.4), `compat` (PHPCompatibilityWP 7.4-, WordPress
  Security and PreparedSQL sniffs), `smoke [--only=single|multisite]` (builds the zip, then
  `tests/smoke/smoke.mjs` on a single site and `tests/smoke/multisite.mjs` on a network, in
  Docker; `AGENTMATE_WPC_PORT` (18990), `AGENTMATE_WPC_MS_PORT` (18991), `AGENTMATE_WPC_KEEP=1`).

## wp-admin and WP-CLI

- One page with tabs (Keys, Connections, Deploys, Audit log, Status): Tools on a single site,
  Network Admin > Settings on multisite. `Admin\AdminPage` is the glue, `Admin\AdminViews` prints
  (escaped where printed), `Admin\AdminActions` decides: capability, then nonce, then the work.
  Nonces are per object (`agentmate_connector_revoke_<id>`, `..._rollback_<id>`). Revoke and roll
  back redirect with `agentmate_notice=<code>`; a new key renders once in the POST reply.
- Rights: manage_options (manage_network_options on multisite) for the page and revoking; write
  keys and rollbacks also need install_plugins and install_themes (so DISALLOW_FILE_MODS blocks
  them for everyone).
- WP-CLI: `wp agentmate key create`, `connections list|revoke <id>`, `deploys list`, `status`,
  `rescue status|rollback`. `Info\StatusChecks` backs both the Status tab and `wp agentmate status`;
  its loopback probe from a WP-CLI container fails in Docker (localhost is the CLI container).
- `build` is plain Node (no Docker, no node_modules; CD runs it on macOS and Windows): checks the
  version in protocol.ts, the header, the PHP constant and readme.txt agree, then writes
  `dist/agentmate-connector.zip` from the `SHIPPED` list (own zip writer on node:zlib, sorted
  entries, 1980-01-01 timestamps, CRLF turned into LF). New top-level files go into `SHIPPED`.
  The smoke fixture installs this zip with `wp plugin install`, so the zip is tested too.
- The schema and guard check (`Activator::maybeUpgrade`) only runs in admin, WP-CLI and our own
  requests, so visitors' page views cost nothing.
- Composer resolves for PHP 7.4.33 (`config.platform`), so one vendor folder runs on 7.4 to 8.4.
- Docker Hub and GitHub downloads time out now and then; the script retries Composer three times.
- In Git Bash, prefix ad hoc `docker run` with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`.

## Shape of the code

- `Http\Dispatcher` is transport-free: `IncomingRequest` in, `OutgoingResponse` out. Entry points:
  `Http\Transport` (REST, admin-ajax), `Guard\GuardRuntime` (rescue routes before regular plugins)
  and `Guard\Rescue` (rescue.php under SHORTINIT). `Routes\Handlers` builds the route maps.
- `Env\Environment` hides every WordPress call; tests use `tests/Support/FakeEnvironment.php` over
  a temp wp-content. `WordPressEnvironment(true)` is the SHORTINIT flavour (no wp-admin includes).
- `Storage\Storage`: `WpdbStorage` and `MemoryStorage`, same semantics. Locks use `kvAdd` (delete
  expired, then `INSERT IGNORE` + row count). Deploy updates are compare-and-set on `state` and
  bump `rev`, so a matched row always counts as changed.
- `Deploy\DeployService` is the transaction; `Deploy\StateMachine::TABLE` is the state table.

## Decisions the contract does not pin

- HTTP status per error code: `Protocol::STATUS`. 413 only for a request body that is too big.
  A file over 64 MiB on read is `pathRejected` with `details.reason = tooLarge`, not `tooLarge`.
- Replies are signed over route (or `-` when the URL named no known route), the request nonce
  (`-` when am_auth did not parse) and the connection id the request named.
- `/hello`: no timestamp check, no nonce stored, body not read. Capabilities: pair, read, audit,
  revoke, deploy, rescue. `rescueUrl` is `plugins_url('rescue.php')` only when it is on the site's
  own origin, else null.
- `/pair`: bundle capped at 64 KiB before and after gunzip. Bad proof or bad signature both count
  as an attempt; 5 attempts burn the pairing. Connection label = key label, else the device name.
  Connection expiry = pairing time + `--expires-in` days.
- Nonces are stored as sha256(`connectionId\nnonce`) (or `pair\nnonce`) for 660 s.
- Rate limiter state is in kv under `rl:<sha256(ip)>`. A locked-out address still lets through a
  signed request naming a live connection (shared NAT); it is fully verified and a bad signature
  counts as another failure. Unknown, unsigned, /hello and /pair stay locked out.
- Audit: refusals that name no known connection are not written (only counted). `authFailed` and
  `rateLimited` are "noise" (column `noise`), capped at 500 on their own, so they never evict the
  2000 real events. One `rateLimited` row per address per lockout.
- Clone safety: the site key option records the raw `home` option. When host, port or path differ
  (scheme does not count), the key is renewed, every connection is revoked, unused keys are
  deleted, and the audit log says why (`Auth\SiteMove`). Checked wherever the key loads (plugin,
  activation, rescue.php).
- Admin pages hold no inline handlers or inline scripts with data in them: confirmations are
  `data-agentmate-confirm` attributes run by one fixed enqueued script (`AdminViews::SCRIPT`).
  Device names and labels pass `Text::displaySafe` before they are stored (no C0/C1 controls,
  bidi overrides or zero-width characters). Remember esc_attr does not double-encode: never put
  escaped user text inside JavaScript.
- Path policy also denies `.npmrc`, `auth.json`, `.netrc`, `.git-credentials`, after NFKC
  (`Normalizer` when ext-intl is there, else a fallback for fullwidth ASCII, the long s, one-dot
  leaders and Latin ligatures).
- Manifest cursor: `<files listed so far>.<base64url(last path)>`. The hash cache never stores or
  trusts files modified in the last 2 seconds (mtime has one-second steps).
- `/files/read`: past the response budget `length: 0`; a vanished file is
  `{offset, length: 0, size: 0, sha256: "", missing: true}`.

## Deploys

- State answers (B's fake mirrors this; "same" = ok with the current state, unchanged):
  - upload: open runs; anything else `invalidState`.
  - commit: open validates (any syntaxErrors, conflicts or refusals: ok, `state: open`, nothing
    touched), else applies; applying resumes; applied, done, rolledBack, aborted, expired: same.
  - verify: applied runs (heartbeat, then health checks; a regression rolls back, answer
    `state: rolledBack, healthy: false`); open and applying `invalidState`; others same.
  - finalize: applied becomes done; done same; everything else `invalidState` (never ok after a
    rollback; details carry state and reason).
  - rollback: open becomes aborted; applying and applied rolledBack(requested); done rolls back if
    its snapshot is kept and nothing changed since, else ok with `state: done` and `conflicts`
    (force overrides); terminal states same.
  - abort: open aborted; applying and applied rolledBack(requested); done `invalidState`; others same.
  - begin while a deploy is active: `busy` with `details.deployId`. Two calls at once: `busy`
    with `details.retryAfter` (the per-site mutex).
- Timeouts: open expires after 30 min without a call. Applying: deadline = last journal save +
  confirm window, rolledBack(interrupted) when passed. Applied: deadline = apply + confirm window,
  pushed by each verify, never past apply + 15 min, then rolledBack(notConfirmed). The confirm
  window is 180 s; `AGENTMATE_CONNECTOR_CONFIRM_SECONDS` (5..180) shortens it for tests.
- Begin and commit refuse (not forceable): path policy reasons, `symlink`, `notWritable` (folder in
  the way, unwritable item), `itemProtected`, `itemUnknown` (missing item without `create`),
  `tooLarge`. Forceable: conflicts, `deletesActivePluginMainFile`, `touchesActiveThemeCore`
  (deleting style.css or index.php of the active theme or its parent). Syntax errors never.
- Puts whose content is already staged (same sha256, including empty files) need no upload; the
  upload reply reports them at full size. Chunks: offset must equal the part's size (a repeat of
  bytes already there is ignored); a hash mismatch on `final` drops the part (`nextOffset: 0`).
- Apply: journal phases `snapshot` (copy every touched file into blobs/) then `apply` (temp file
  in the same folder, rename, unlink-then-rename fallback). Both phases repeat safely, so the
  journal is saved every 2 s and at the end of the time budget. Any write error rolls back
  (interrupted). Kept: 20 history records, snapshots of the 5 newest done deploys.
- Data dir: `blobs/<sha256>` and `parts/<deploy>-<op>`, garbage-collected after each finish.
- Guard: `guard/00-agentmate-connector-guard.php` is a template; activation (and maybeUpgrade)
  writes it into mu-plugins with the plugin folder filled in; deactivation first rolls back
  (interrupted) or aborts any pending deploy, then removes it. Its option
  `agentmate_connector_guard` always exists, autoloaded, `''` when idle (multisite: a network
  option, one small query). Pending value: `{d, t, f}` (deploy id, deadline, changed PHP files).
- rescue.php finds wp-load.php through `rescue-config.php` (written into the plugin folder on
  activation), else by walking up. It answers only the rescue routes and nothing when the plugin
  is inactive.

## Smoke fixture

`tests/smoke/fixture.mjs` exports `startWordPressFixture({ port, multisite }) -> { url, port, name,
multisite, wp(args), exec(cmd), writeFile(path, content), keyFor(scope, { label, expiresIn }),
stop() }` and `connectorZip()`. MariaDB + `wordpress:php8.3-apache` (Apache moved to the host
port by `tests/docker/start-apache.sh`, so loopback works) + one-off `wordpress:cli-php8.3`
containers, WP_DEBUG logging on, display off, admin / admin. With `multisite: true` it converts to
a subdirectory network (WordPress multisite works on a non-standard port here) and
network-activates the connector. `tests/smoke/client.mjs` is a plain-Node signed client and
`tests/smoke/admin.mjs` a cookie-jar wp-admin session.
