# AgentMate Mobile

A React Native (Expo) controller app for AgentMate's Remote feature. It connects
directly to an AgentMate desktop instance that is hosting (Remote → Host tab)
over your local network — same AnyDesk-style WebSocket protocol the desktop
app uses to control itself, defined once in
[`@agentmat/protocol`](../../packages/protocol) and shared by both apps.

## Running it

From the repo root:

```sh
pnpm mobile
```

This builds `@agentmat/protocol` and starts the Expo dev server. Scan the
printed QR code with **Expo Go** (iOS/Android) to run the app on your phone —
no Xcode/Android Studio setup required. Your phone and the computer running
AgentMate must be on the same Wi-Fi network.

Alternatively, from this directory: `pnpm start` (or `pnpm android` / `pnpm ios`
if you have the native toolchains installed).

## Using it

1. On the desktop, open **Remote → Host**, start hosting, and generate a
   pairing code.
2. On the phone, tap **Scan QR** and point the camera at the desktop's QR
   code — or paste the `AGENTMATE1:…` code by hand.
3. Once connected, the host's screen streams in as tiles you can tap/drag to
   click and move the cursor, two-finger drag to scroll, and long-press for a
   right click. The bottom bar opens the system keyboard for typing and has
   Esc/Tab/Enter/Backspace/arrow keys the soft keyboard can't send. The
   "Clipboard" button pushes your phone's clipboard to the host; clipboard
   text sent from the host is copied to the phone automatically.

## What's not implemented yet

File transfer (the desktop's "Send file" in the Connect tab) isn't
implemented on mobile — chunks for an incoming file are silently ignored.
Hosting from the phone (letting a desktop control the phone) is also out of
scope; this app is controller-only.

## Code layout

- `src/remote/useRemoteClient.ts` — the WebSocket state machine (hello/auth,
  screen-info, binary tile frames, input, clipboard). Mirrors the controller
  role in `apps/desktop/src/main/remote/manager.ts`, but the socket is opened
  directly here since there's no separate main/renderer process to protect.
- `src/components/TileCanvas.tsx` — renders incoming JPEG tiles as an
  absolutely-positioned mosaic (no `<canvas>` in React Native) and turns
  touch gestures into the same normalized `RemoteInputEvent`s the desktop's
  `RemoteScreen.tsx` sends from mouse events.
- `src/components/Toolbar.tsx` — soft-keyboard capture + special keys.
- `src/screens/ConnectScreen.tsx` / `src/screens/RemoteScreen.tsx` — the two
  screens; `App.tsx` switches between them based on connection status.
