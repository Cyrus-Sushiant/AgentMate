/**
 * The override file that keeps services behind the proxy off the public interfaces: every port
 * they publish is bound to 127.0.0.1 instead, so nginx on the same server reaches them and
 * nothing outside does. The user's compose file stays untouched; the core passes this file to
 * `docker compose` after it.
 *
 * It has to use Compose's `!override` tag. A plain override file merges `ports:` by adding to the
 * list, so the original binding on every interface would survive next to the loopback one.
 * `!override` replaces the list instead, which needs Docker Compose 2.24.4 or later.
 *
 * The bindings are written out in full (long syntax, one per port, ranges expanded) from the
 * file as read with the stack's environment, which is what Compose sees on the server.
